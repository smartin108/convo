My job is loss sensitive billing. Their last claims i was able to invoice were only until May 31. They do not like me much now. Some of these insureds incur close to $500k in losses alone in one month so at least 3 in a row billed in one fell swoop will not be taken well. Plus it'll mess withe their held collateral and blahblahblah. And there are 34 policies i havent been able to input yet, not even to collect their policy deposits. So we're just throwing free coverage everywhere i guess</td></tr>

I wonder the same, in reverse. Especially because no one sees me, ever.  I showed you the impressive things so you wouldnt dismiss or forget me and ao i could show you i was worthy of your time. It also reminds me that i am not nothing

My mom became an on call firefighter and emt when i was 8 and i have no recollection of my father's familial involvement other than mandated holiday pictures. Like, no idea when he came home from work or any of that. So she would get paged to a fire call and that would always be a minimum of an hour and change of us being at the house alone. Because it was a completely on call department, she worked as she pleased, 24/7/365. And she had insane pride at her 100% response records</td></tr>

So what became of father? Is he still walking the earth?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">He is still walking the earth. He calls once or twice a year. I get a check twice a year that's dismal based on what i know. 

He only has my number because my brother accidentally gave it to him one time. It really was an accident.

My mother made me call him while i was sitting in the ambulance and the house was still in flames and my brother was about to be brought up in a body bag. It wasnt that she was too sad - her sister and her best friends were tgere and ao was her fire department. She just hates him that much. Her best insult has always been a reactive "you're just like your father" if she was really pissed off. To my brother or me.

That father of ours lives in Florida now. At The Villages. Go ahead and google it. He moved there like 12 hours after telling me.

They divorced when i was 13 or 14. He moved out and lived 4 miles away. The next time i saw him i was 24. He lived in Gaylord from some time after i was 18 until he moved to Florida. 

What else would you like to know? That's a legit question</td></tr>

To me, his last day of living and the last time i saw him or any pets or that my house and belongings existed is August 8. I woke up August 9. So for those 2 or so hours in between,  it's schroedingers guess. And i have no idea when he died either. Official cod was carbon monoxide but there was plenty else it could have been. I have more to say on that maybe but whatever. He was unsaveable at any point during the fire, so August 8 makes more sense to me.

He was not touched by any flames. Fire moves up & out like a mushroom cloud first and he was in the center of the basement. That's always a question whether you want to admit it or not. I also remember very little for a while after that, so the 8th is as good  as any. It's also easier to remember because it was my cousin's birthday</td></tr>

What part of speech is that word playing in the initialism, in your opinion</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Hmm. That's one i haven't given much thought to. Are you asking if i think it's diectically refereing to the subject Daylight so there should be a verb ending in singular/plural agreement? One could argue both ways

For this instance, i just typed iut what I've always heard, no extra thought given </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Daylight is singular to me at first, but you could argue plurality based on it being more than one occasion over the course of time because in order to ise the system properly you need to have DST twice a year and then it happens every year</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Thanks for the thoughts. I would argue against twice a year being a requirement, but that's a different matter

I also said savings most of my life until I saw a discussion that convinced me that saving is a verb here: we save daylight. Savings to me sounds like a plural or mass noun, which is fine in and of itself (e.g., savings and loan), but it does not make sense to me to think of the resource as having some accumulation </td></tr>

Of course our stories are not much alike, yet we both find ourselves in this, may I say perverse situation where we have to hide things from our partner. Do you agree?

</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">One more bit </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">The answer is there is no why. So there is no point in putting energy into that one. It would be like asking what is the mpg of an electric car. It's a silly question, if you will. 

Instead, we can ask what can we do to be our have or go to what we want, and choose

    <tr><td width="80%">Let me try and explain why i was confused. 

I am breathing really intentionally because i feel bad for having been confusing and i thought i had been really clear.

I have a really, really hard time with that word. I literally cannot say "rape" for anyone. So i default to putting "SA" because it somehow makes it not as bad in my brain. Like I should think of it nicer. I need to work on that.

So. Spelling it out

Those 2 I've told you were rape. That's why your text confused me, because i thought that was already clear that that was kind of THE whole thing of my past</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I'm sorry about that</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">And then i got more confused because anyone else in that list of 8 "worst" that i count is also rape

If we downplay to sexual assault and i include less bad things like just being forced for some things and not others (like if we were going with degrees in a court of law) there would be lesser offenses but 8 are unquestionable to me even though i get questioned enough on enough of them</td></tr>

    <tr><td width="80%">I think it's nor as angry as you should be, but i also think she won't understand because there's not much she actually realizes she's not doing well with</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I think it's too nice, kind of.  Like you're holding back </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Interesting. Anything else?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Maybe. Let me reread

And please keep in mind i have no real background for detailed dynamicals, just what youve told me in vague swatches </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Sure, of course </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I dont know how to respond best. What was her shitty behavior? I dont know what actually happened

We can table this for another time, obv</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">All good. You are correct I was holding back. She would not have heard anything I said correctly at that point

I can summarize:</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">First, she disapproved of me hanging with Patrick this weekend because of a distorted memory she has of him being a drunk. There is a kennel of truth there, but she was also clearly conflating him with someone else from work. And he did use to get drink with Toni 's husband Brad, who became abusive (Patrick was not though, and ended his relationship with Brad at that time)</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Second, after I got that clarified, then she changed her argument to Patrick was always bad-mouthing AF, and that rubbed off on me. Which is basically true, but this was my first time hearing it. I've been friends with Patrick for like 8 years or more. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">She stomps off. I go back to work. Then she comes back to apologize. I ask her if she remembers me saying I can't have simple adult conversations with her?  

So third, now her problem is I am mad. I did get worked up and tried to draw an analogy for her: how about I say nope! I disapprove you hanging with Toni! Of course it's absurd, but now she has completely flipped the script:  she can't say anything to me because I get mad. 

I point out I was only dating I wanted to hang out with a friend this weekend--a very normal things to do, and I had no idea she was harboring this ill opinion of Patrick (which has already morphed , as you'll have noticed) but she decided to spring that on me today</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Finally, I never spend time with her. I never ask her on a date. I never ask her if she wants to get dinner. And she can't say anything to me because I get mad. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">So, thoughts?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Oh, and she didn't say anything to me about going to lunch. I think I was supposed to interpret that as grace. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I held back because there is no listening. She cannot, it will not hear me </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">So it's pointless unless she is actually paying attention</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Lol I said summarize. I guess retell would have been a better word. Sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I'm really sorry you've had to deal with all of that

Please do not be sorry

I'm unsure what to think other than i commiserate and wish i could rescue you from this</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I appreciate it. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">What else would you like to say?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I will find the right opportunity to try to explain that I don't feel like we're friends anymore because she acts this way. And maybe that's why I don't want to hang out</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I don't know when that will be</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">She is painting this as "we both did this". I will correct her on that as well. She did this, not me</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I understand</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">She can deal with that however she wants</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Have you thought of any negative outcome that could befall you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">There won't be. Just her being a banshee</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">What did you hope and expect my feedback and reaction to be? They can be 2 different things too</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I genuinely wanted to know if I am missing something. I still do. I understand this is one side of a story, and there was a lot of who heard/who said. In the past, I usually would find enough wrongdoing of my own to apologize. I feel none of that this time. I have never been this clear about what is going on. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I think you're right. I also think she might think you're blindsiding her because you usually say nothing</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I can see that. She interprets push-back as anger. </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">From me anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Do you outright say (in a calm voice) " I'm not angey, i want you to know that first... i feel _______ because ________"

Btw, i know these phrases from decades of therapy and am not trying to be critical of you - i know how I've been spoken to and what's effective and blahblahblah</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">And it can't be "im not angry BUT" because that negates it</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">And you cant actually be angry</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">If you are, then say that but back it up with specifics (not "always" or absolute language like that)</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Dont throw sensitive topics and past behavior at her if it isn't relevant</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">That is all extremely helpful!</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I know these things, but they are not always the first things I think of, and certainly those were not words I used today</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">It takes actual, literal practice</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Say it out loud</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">As much as I've said I've gotten good at sensing an argument, I blew right through the cues today</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">And breathe in 3 to 4 counts then out the same before you say anything at all. Look away, close your eyes if you need to</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I'm with you 100% on all this</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">The reminder is golden</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">You are such a gem</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">You can actively say that you do not have the capacity to engage in a productive discussion at that moment but you realize that there's a valuable exchange that needs to take place and you want to dedicate the time it deserves later when you have that

Say it calmly, like you're reading aloud to a classroom

I appreciate that, thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Thank you so much

I thought I was going to have to use that last one today. 

But she waited 6 hours and I was plenty defused by then</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">You do not have to qualify which type kf capacity either (emotional, temporal, logical, etc). Capacity is enough.

If she balks at that, repeat what you already said. Same tone. Same cadence. Same words.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Agree </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Dont antagonize with repetition though. If you have to, resort to real reasons why. People are counting on you to do your job. You don't want heated emotions to hurt either of you. You know it isnt healthy to get worked up. You're hungry. It isn't a one off thing.</td></tr>

What are your thoughts, besides obvious disappointment?</td></tr>

Alsp, i am so so sorry! I had no idea this would happen. Literally said he was leaving to retrieve her as he went out the door

On the plus side, he gave me extra cash and stipulationless shopping trips this weekend so i guess there's that

I should have all of next weekend alone here or I'll peace out to a different town, depends what you want

Go somewhere platonic (shopping, drinking, food/coffee, chomping gummies, idc)

Find a discreet field? Lol

Find a local lodging establishment that has a check in time that still leaves a few hours (3pm is common but i can call around). Make those minutes count. West side or dewitt preferred

Can i ask what you mean?

You're asking if I'm trying to be victimized again, right?

What makes you ask that?

And what would you be doing to harm me?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I don't mean to suggest that you want to be victimized. It's my armchair psychologist understanding that there is a pattern of behavior in which victims of SA, DA, etc., unwittingly find themselves in such situations again in part because they don't know better for themselves. It's not that they want it as such, but they can't break the cycle</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">My response (typed as you were typing too)

I went kind of off the deep end 3 or 3.5 years ago when i heard all this confirmed and some more upsetting stuff about my brother and pieces together a lot. That all happened by accident one day, i just stumbled across the info. I was also trying to deal with my own past SA traumas with a shitty psychologist who made a lot of things worse for me. He (psychologist) "broke up with me" in an email the day i was scheduled to see him, which was the day after tgis new wave of information and realization drowned me. Then i made a lot of bad, slutty, dangerous decisions. Promiscuity is a common trait in SA survivors.  I sought out good and bad and worse and different and everything. I was craving a lot too. 

Ive played with the idea of cnc but i dont think i am mentally sound enough for it to be cathartic like it can be and i dont think anyone i trust enough to engage in cnc with me actually would. Plus i dont fight back or flight away - i faun/freeze and dissociate.

I will never let an SA happen again and that was ultra clear to me 3 years ago all of a sudden

Is that what you needed?

    <tr><td width="80%">That's what i meant</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Theory (because it happens to me a lot): too many carbs at once without enough of a satiety nutrient to accompany them. Your pancreas dumps out a bunch of insulin to unlock your cells so they can receive the sugar as a nutrient but your pancreas doesnt get the "stop sending insulin" message until after you've been done consuming the carbs for a while. The extra insulin makes your glucose drop more and your liver is balancing with tiny amounts of glucagok to keep your levels steady but the macros are way off from your norm so your body sends alarms (shaking, sweating, etc) to let you know you need external input to help itself regulate because your body knows something is "off" and your survival brain can find a way to fix itself faster than relevelling between hormones, so it makes you food focused and all that</td></tr>

    <tr><td width="80%">Very interesting!</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">TLDR: too much sugar, spiked glucose, adrenaline dump from extra caffeine, unsustainable energy levels, insluon compensates, you fix it </td></tr>

    <tr><td width="80%">And it was a lot more carb load than I would feed myself at home</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Ideal macro is supposedly 40-30-30, carb-protein-fats</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I have a differebt but similar theory</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I dont eat pizza, not really (variety of reasons)

One reason is that because it's mostly fat and then mostly carb after that, the fat delays the carbs from getting into your system. Then a few later you have the carb surge out of nowhere and subsequently drop because there's no protein or satiety to carry the sugar spike through. Instead of a steady line of nutrients (like the ideal), you instead would have straihjt upward spike then drop in my forst theory or steady/small drop then upspike then low drop in theory 2</td></tr>

I obv associate sex with pain. This will sound bizarre, but SA doesn't always hurt but it also still does in the memory in places of your body. After enough oww over years, i get sort of aroused (but not really? I feel throbbing but it's at the bits that have been really hurt before) anyway, and i get wet. I feel pain, my body thinks it knows what's coming next, and it prepares, it's not something i think about it just happens and it's so, so bizarre to feel</td></tr>

You have a closet. There or may not be a monster in the closet. Schr√∂edinger's monster? You kind of want to know, but kind of not. It might be horrible for you--and for me--if there's a real monster. But you can't know for sure without opening the door. But every day you don't have an answer. You can't know the answer unless you open the door. 

It's not an enviable place to be. If you want to open the closet, you have my support. If you'd rather wait until I'm physically there, that's cool. Any way you want to proceed is cool in fact. 

I don't think you can break me. I don't think you can hurt me, unless you turn against me, but I don't see that happening. </td></tr>

I'm not saying that's the case, but idk really</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">TLDR ...

I think you think you imagine i might try not existing anymore one of these days and at that point you'd do what you had to to prevent me taking a permanent exit

I can't be with him that way after he did what he wanted to without any consent from me several years ago. I kind of agree that i deserved it then but also not really.

He is more persistent lately, being touchy and lovey and maiing physical and verbal advances all. The. Time. And i cannot. I just cant. There's not a way for me to check out like i normally could. I cant get into it. I cant not say no. And i cant say no without a huge argument now and huge amounts of me feeling bad about myself for a lot of reasons. 

This is just another reason i cant and dont sleep. Really. 

But wtf am i supposed to do??

There isn't  a way out and isnt a way i can stay like things are and not a way i would want to be physical with him again and he isnt going to stop feeling how he is. And i am completely alone.

For example, if I'm going to be alone tomorrow afternoon, my choices are to stay and clean, go out on my own, or be here with you. It's insanely hard for me to balance what i should do and want to do with deciding where and when to go anywhere because since i dont drive, when i go out I'm out and when i do that it's for hours but there are also opening and closing times and some places open some days and not others and i can't figure out if i should stay here alone next week or tell L he can bring his sister back and they can stay

The best way i can put it - but i dont want too much pressure - is that i plan everything around you, so how do i decide when i should do other things when I'm waiting on a maybe, and all the available time spots i might have overlap?</td></tr>

This was negotiated last week with the condition that my life not be infringed upon by her being here again (you know this saga but this "weekend" is still too much, again, like it always is). So i begrudingly agree with a condition that if i want to go somewhere to shop.or have ciffee or whatever, he'll take me or pick me up or both and doesn't get to harp on what I'm doing or where i go or what i get. Furniture or super large purchases was an exception

So he took me. I reluctantly agreed to try and stick to not tons of stuff or tons of cost. Spent the day doung what i love, obv. 

He came to pick me up later and i was kind of waddling out since there arent carts and i could use 1 arm but i had some bigger weekender-style duffle ish bags over me but also you have to press the door lock things and push the door to get out....

Anyway he screamed that he's had it and he's done and what dont i understand. Chastised more in the car ride home and talked to like I'm literally a toddler. Already felt uneasy with all that and he would not let me speak (and i havent since that moment, with one exception) and more berating and all sorts of that </td></tr>

Him is named Mike. Was the hall directir who hired me. And her fir that matter. Actually hired me to replace her now that i think about the housing places that needed to be filled when i became an RA. She broke him so i was fun to get attention from and for him to lead on and so on and so forth. For 2 years. 

When noon hit on the day we closed down the dorm and he migrated to a different position at Ferris i brought up that he was no longer my boss and "im not moving to east coast for another few days, im completely dateable and encouraging you, we'll both be around next year and it would be a lot of fun" </td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">I got the invite to go get lunch (for the rest of staff) with him and hang out in his car doing so. Then i got some pats on the back for the balls i had for saying anything because he knew it was probably terrifying for me to be that vulnerable

I told him that i knew he knew because (names) werent subtle and i knew they joked with him about me and my smittenness for those preceding years

    <tr><td width="80%">Because it is just now occurring to me that he wasnt ever the type who wanted physical gain from this, and he wasn't the malicious type (to my knowledge), but i was hopeless and it probably felt great for him to have me parade around all cute and be smart and sassy and have goals and depend on him and him know he didnt officially break any rules 

And there was all this connection of dark and twisty but still outwardly positive and taking over life even though it kept fucking us over

I don't know what i was. I was so sure we would end up at least messing around for a while, if not dating. 

I'll get some pics from then so you can see who each of us is in these instances.

I was at the very literal darkest parts of my life more than a few times 

So maybe he liked being the rescuer? Maybe he liked the ego boost? Knowing me better than other people could because i just never said anything to anyone but him? He knew so, so much and now I'm really turned upside down

Was it just fun to have a silent power trip?

I write this letter to him that i never sent and all it was was me crying and pleading and wondering if i was too messed up mentally because of everything and that's why he didnt want me</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">He would see me stay awake for days, see my cuts, know when i didnt eat or when i was in a vomiting cycle, was the first one i told about my brother

He held me in the hallway when i had a panic attack while we were in the group of a dozen of us training for dorm scenarios we needed to be prepared for and i collapsed in a flashback because the scene we had was to figure out how to manage a sexual assault in one of our residents if it happened</td></tr>

    <tr><td width="80%">Not only do all the dorms look the same, but this dorm where we're playing pretend for training was THAT GUY'S  dorm and there's so much there too that i want to tell you</td></tr>

In this moment now and a lot of times like it i dont really know how to describe the feeling of defeat i have. It's like i dont care enough to actively die but not a ton to prevent it either. And right now it's hard when I'm not well and i see this pro and con list kind of like long swathes of luxury ribbon and the pro list is so short and the con list curls up at the bottom because the ribbon is so long. 

I get impulsive a lot, but not to the stage of instantly taking a bunch of pills or ingesting anything else or even injecting. I dont know why. That's been the case very few times, and in those instances i was too young or dumb to know what would have been truly lethal. Small victories i guess for that.

But in the down and out when i think of how there's so much i will always have to fight for just to keep existing, or surviving, and not even living,  it's just not worth it anymore to me.

And this precedes you; I first learned about self-harm among Millennials and GenZ when my non-bio niece in AR made a mess of herself. She's morbidly obese, grew up in abject poverty, had a horrible mother (who died young from complications of diabetes). Her father is the sick brother-in-law the fam is trekking to AR to visit. (She's fine now. Still 400+ lbs, but tackling life successfully.) Then I learned my closest coworker was a cutter. He shared it with me. I don't ask about it. You explained it to me in a way that helps me understand why you did similar things, but it makes me very uneasy. I don't want to hide from the knowledge, but I don't know what to do with it as someone who cares about you.

It is surprising to me how long you two kept this going. And he didn't jump your bones? Guy's either got a lot of self-control, or he didn‚Äôt actually care (and I don't believe the latter, based on your story).
</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Job satisfaction (4): I can only relate my own experience here. I do the extras not because I want to be recognized, but because my satisfaction comes from a happy customer and a job well done in my own view. I am always my harshest critic. Recognition is nice and all, but I've found that few actually understand what it takes to do the thing worthy of being recognized. I don't care about that. And by that I don't mean "I'm bitter and dislike that people don't get it". I mean "My customer is happy. I know I did a good thing. The fools around me are content to do minimum necessary and that's their loss." I legit don't worry about what others think any more. Life is too short.
</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">What sexual gratification looks like (5): Kinda funny, but as I'm writing this I realize my answer for this is kind of similar to the job satisfaction one. I know I did a good job if my customer is happy and I'm happy with how I serviced her. And in many ways, that's good enough for me. I suppose some of what I feel here is learned behavior because I've spent a long time having vanilla sex and, you know, after 30 years you might just get to a point where this is normal. I do have fantasies that are out of that box but in the moment I think I default to what I know. And I'm ok with that. I'm not saying I don't want to try other things. You know how I say I need to get out of my head? This is what I'm talking about. How to escape the learned behavior and try something new? This is not a well-developed skill for me.

Last night I was a bit high and we were snuggling and having a good time when I fucked up bigtime. I told her about the drunk  I had with a drunk, nameless, faceless short and pleasingly plump girlie at the Machine Shop... The shows had just ended and people were going for last potty and I was milling around on the floor vibing in the energy of the show that had just finished. This girl is suddenly waltzing up to me, wraps an arm around me, and we spin around with actually some grace and I have one arm around her and have the presence of mind to grab her tit--

And then it was like a scene in a drama movie when the power surge blows up the lamps in the room and everything goes dark but for bits of sparks here and there.

And so the body preserves itself (it's why fetuses can spontaneously self abort if the mom is nutritionally deficient since the mom cant even support her own needs, and why in hypothermia people lose limbs when blood necessary for survival keeps the core/vital organs warm instead by rerouting blood supply), so anyway, to prevent massive actual trauma, self lubrication is not necessarily only when I'm aroused</td></tr>

Right. It turns out that in the time it took me to look up all of this information, "they" have done some maintenance and invalidated a dozen payees for no apparent reason. Oh well, I guess I'll go look them up again. 

Oh look it turns out your department inactivated 3 payees I need to get paid.

Oh look it turns out your department flat out deleted one.

Oh look it turns out your department changed the code use to identify 8 other payees. 

It took me over an hour to figure out what your department fucked up.

You can inflate something
You can deflate something

Why can you not flate something?</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">Like being over or under whelmed</td></tr>
    <tr><td width="80%">"Evidently so! (Edit: And not just in Europe.)

The contemporary word "overwhelm" comes from the Old English -hwielfan, meaning "cover over," which then became the Middle English whelmen, meaning "cover" or "to turn upside down."

When it first arose in the 14th century, "overwhelm" also meant "to turn upside down," but could also mean "to overthrow," and (later) "to submerge completely." Both "whelm" and "overwhelm" were most often used in the context of ships being overpowered or submerged by rough seas until "whelm" eventually faded from common use.

So, in sum, "overwhelm" is a somewhat redundant way of saying "whelm.""

To me, that meant that that's all you can ever smell on me, after me, after my house, it lingered in your room and your car and it does on you when we depart. That it's everywhere all the time where ever i have been and since you'll be here this week and maybe in some sheets, those sheets also cannot have been laundered in the scented things

I think you and i communicate better than almost anyone I've ever been around. I wish i could tell or show you that somehow 

3.
I dont know how to respond to that. I have thoughts: you have helped in very literal ways, i cant be helped like i would like, and i feel increasingly selfish for you feeling the way you do on this issue. We can work out more of this if you'd like.</td></tr>
