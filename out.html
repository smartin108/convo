I was living in France. 7th grade health is basically phase 2 of sex ed and my parents waivered me out of that unit. 10th grade health is the last installment and i tested out of that class.... since you can't mandate sex ed teaching, it couldnt be on the testing out test

I never had sex ed in school. There's a little more that branches off from there, but that probably explains a decent chunk </td></tr>

It sure doesn't make sense to me. Then again I had sex ed in 6th grade and maybe some other time, and frankly learned more from books at home. And no, my parents had nothing resembling porn ever. Not that kind  of people lol</td></tr>

My job is loss sensitive billing. Their last claims i was able to invoice were only until May 31. They do not like me much now. Some of these insureds incur close to $500k in losses alone in one month so at least 3 in a row billed in one fell swoop will not be taken well. Plus it'll mess withe their held collateral and blahblahblah. And there are 34 policies i havent been able to input yet, not even to collect their policy deposits. So we're just throwing free coverage everywhere i guess</td></tr>

You didn't exactly explain--you were pretty sleepy lol. I picked up that you were pretty wiped out by the workout. </td></tr>

To girlsplain it, when someone is hyperaware and fight-flighting for a very long time, once they finally feel safe or like they can actually relax, there's no way to combat the tired that comes over them</td></tr>

You seem out of character</td></tr>

    <tr><td>A few reasons

I like you
You mire than deserved it
I wanted you to think of me as more than nothing
I like to stand out for good memories
I want you to like me back
I dont know how else i would do anything, if that makes sense
Too many people have told me i wasnt this or that or whatever, so i made it a point to prove them wrong
A little bit of conditioning
I do that for myself when I'm swirling and it helps remind me I'm more than garbage

Why you? Well, you said yes, i liked your instant friendliness, and i think you saw me drowning a little and cared
I just felt connected

Why do you ask?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also knew at my core, pretty quickly, that something intimate was going to happen between us, though i wasnt exactly sure what or who would be involved </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I did not understand why you should trust me. You have a deeply disturbing story. I care deeply about you, and want to protect you. But you could not know this, surely, at the outset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>By day 2 though, I knew you wanted me to follow you down this path. And I knew I wanted to follow you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Same

I do have an observation and what is probably a disturbing statement </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Is it?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Are you asking what it is?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Disturbing statement you have?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I trust you, but have been wrong before, so in my mind there's not really anything you would do to me that i couldnt handle. And if i realllllly couldnt handle it, i have set plans for how to deal with it on my own

Basically there isnt a whole lot more trauma thar anyone can do that i havent experienced at some level already and the worat that happens is i die, and ive been okay with that for a long time

I also didnt think you could or would do anything malicious. It's a sense i have and have opted to ignore before bit i felt none of that with you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Is there a reason you're going down this path of questions? I'm looking to see where these thoughts are originating from and maybe why

Like, are you asking to do some different playing? I am open to a lot, you just have to communicate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also just want to say that we met at a very odd point for me and i fully believe the universe worked some magic to place you where i desperately needed someone and hopefully i cancome close to filling the same role foe you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm only asking because I have struggled to understand why a girl like you cares about a boy like me. It's not something I worry about. More like wonderment. 

I really like you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also believe that my destiny is to absorb the bad. I have the mentality of "at least it's me and i can handle whatever, or i know what to do if it's too much". I've felt that way as long as i can remember. I feel like some hybrid of a martyr, a siren, and an albatross. Honestly.

I wonder the same, in reverse. Especially because no one sees me, ever.  I showed you the impressive things so you wouldnt dismiss or forget me and ao i could show you i was worthy of your time. It also reminds me that i am not nothing

I really like you too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok
Phew
I need to put phone down and sleep
I really really really wish I was holding you, but I am lucky to have done that before so I can remember happy thoughts

    <tr><td>I just have no idea what your plans are</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You dont need to tell me super specifics, but some things i def need to know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>AMA 

I don't really have a plan. But maybe I could put on a character. Or maybe I just do all the things I like to do to you, like</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lick your neck</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kiss your eyes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Suck your nipples</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lick your ear</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Or maybe we could just talk about the fabulous History of jams in Belgium and have tea! Yum!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Anyhoo</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm going through this HARD drive and found a bunch of outtakes or "might post later" stuff. Idk how you feel about unsolicited things like that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sorry for the delay, almost had a disaster</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Please share</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And if you want to hurt me, we talk about it first is all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Whoa is everything ok? 

Hurt/pain -- I feel like this is probably best discussed in person because of the nuance

#1 never pain from anger, never 
#2 not for it's own sake 

Sometimes a pinch or tap or even butt smack can be fun, ymmv. 

I will never hit my baby in the face. Never. It makes me physically recoil when I see that. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's like, even if you want that, I'm not going there</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay, these are solid answers, thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Though i will say it's a tiny bit confusing because aside from your 2 reasons, why would there be pain?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ah--i see the issue. 

One moment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am threatening you with the idea that we're going to go long, hard, hot, and maybe more than once

When you asked how many pain pills,I assumed the above would lead you to a place of passion because of your back. So I played along with a stupidly high medicine dose

Then I realized hey if that is an actual issue(at any level) we should talk. 

Because I don't actually want to hurt you beyond lovey traps</td></tr>
    <tr><td>*TAPS</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lol at taps

I understand more of where you're coming from. And your line of thinking and resp9nse wasnt stupid, just not aligned with what i thought

And i figured my eye makeup would be messed up from crying

Im really sorry I'm this way </td></tr>
    <tr><td>No need to be sorry. Too much is lost in translation in text

Very simply, no violence, no scary, only what is fun for both of us. And the part about fun is not just me saying that. I now understand where some people are fine with intimacy being a one-way deal and that is not me. That makes me ill and I really don't like it. </td></tr>

    <tr><td>I'm not sure I know either. I've honestly never heard a story like the one you've told me so far. I've had a fairly sheltered life</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay. Which story, because i dont know thar youve heard the worst. And that's a subjective term</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Short story is blahblahblah damage and blahblahblah it's nice to not exsanguinate and blahblahblah no one wanted to do a hysterectomy since there wasn't anything malognant or biologically "wrong", hence iud</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Burning the house down with himself in it</td></tr>

Let's not forget i was in it too, and my pets and my mom</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But.....i haven't told you a lot</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want to know things that are important, but I have no way to prioritize because I don't know what I don't know. If you think it's important for me to know, I will listen</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Does that make sense?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think so

I dont want you broken though

But i feel like these should be told to you, and it's my core feeling to have to know them. That you deserve them,kind of</td></tr>

    <tr><td>‚ù§</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because i dont know if this is clear, my father's actions were just that once, or at least not more than that week. It was 7 more years of my brother and it only stopped then for really shitty reasons 

But remember how i say i was born an adult and raised myself? Yeah. My mom became an on call firefighter and emt when i was 8 and i have no recollection of my father's familial involvement other than mandated holiday pictures. Like, no idea when he came home from work or any of that. So she would get paged to a fire call and that would always be a minimum of an hour and change of us being at the house alone. Because it was a completely on call department, she worked as she pleased, 24/7/365. And she had insane pride at her 100% response records</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Wow. I definitely had times when the folks weren't home, but they were well defined and expected. You were pretty much forced to grow up fast</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I literally do not remember not being in an adult mindset. And that sucks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah I'm sorry. I mean it's easy to forget what childhood was like sometimes, but there are definitely bits and pieces. Not all good, not all bad either. But memories of not being an adult and all that entails is not something I would want to just give up. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>So you're clear on the last big text i sent, right?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And thank sweet baby jesus it's after 1615</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Today was A DAY</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah that totally makes sense. 

So what became of father? Is he still walking the earth?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>He is still walking the earth. He calls once or twice a year. I get a check twice a year that's dismal based on what i know. 

He only has my number because my brother accidentally gave it to him one time. It really was an accident.

My mother made me call him while i was sitting in the ambulance and the house was still in flames and my brother was about to be brought up in a body bag. It wasnt that she was too sad - her sister and her best friends were tgere and ao was her fire department. She just hates him that much. Her best insult has always been a reactive "you're just like your father" if she was really pissed off. To my brother or me.

That father of ours lives in Florida now. At The Villages. Go ahead and google it. He moved there like 12 hours after telling me.

They divorced when i was 13 or 14. He moved out and lived 4 miles away. The next time i saw him i was 24. He lived in Gaylord from some time after i was 18 until he moved to Florida. 

What else would you like to know? That's a legit question</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At some point, you must have had a medical professional notice signs of SA. Or did that not happen? If they did, why is father not in prison?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I didnt ever see doctors except for diabetes, and that wasn't anything that was addressed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At one point you insinuated that mom was complicit in father's actions. Or I interpreted it that way. Is that correct for me to say?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think I'm actually making a lot of assumption there. If I'm way off base lmk</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And maybe it's super obvious what I'm looking for here.... Explanations and justice. I know this is all ground you've already treaded. And maybe the perverse answer is there is no reason and no justice in it. Idk. I am sorry these things happened to you. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your statements are correct. I don't know how much she knew about what my father did - i can tell you more later (decided i needed to wscape the house for a sec) but i/we (brother) were walked in on more than once and her/their responses there were abysmal at best</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok thanks. I need to process this for a bit. Thank you for telling me. (‚ô•Ô∏è) For you</td></tr>
    <tr><td> If you processing this means you dont want to be physical anymore then you'll need to tell me that very specifically</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i would not blame you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No babe that's not it at all. 
More </td></tr>
    <tr><td>It makes me want to be with you more. For hugs and stuff. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And it's a heavy story. I don't get a lot of those</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But I want to know everything! Lol
In time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You okay?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am good! How do? I wasn't sure if you were escaping or something </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I mean, kind of escaping. Just temporary, am back home. Was close to your house actually. I am quite a lot

I am okay. I think in physical pain? It's hard to tell. Just drank a teensy tiny bottle of Pink Whitney. Yep, totally basic vibes here lol

Cleaning and crafting now. Working 1.5 hours tomorrow, then quick doc appt (oh, might bring that back up - nothing wrong but it's an interesting point) then taking the rest of the day to do what i please</td></tr>

And i do not doubt any of this, but i think perhaps your perspective on lengths of time might be different that what most people (me/i) would think</td></tr>

To me, his last day of living and the last time i saw him or any pets or that my house and belongings existed is August 8. I woke up August 9. So for those 2 or so hours in between,  it's schroedingers guess. And i have no idea when he died either. Official cod was carbon monoxide but there was plenty else it could have been. I have more to say on that maybe but whatever. He was unsaveable at any point during the fire, so August 8 makes more sense to me.

He was not touched by any flames. Fire moves up & out like a mushroom cloud first and he was in the center of the basement. That's always a question whether you want to admit it or not. I also remember very little for a while after that, so the 8th is as good  as any. It's also easier to remember because it was my cousin's birthday</td></tr>

I stay hyperactive but zombie like. So I'll be doing a lot on autopilot and just glazed staring ahead

    <tr><td>You have trouble swallowing?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right now i am. Only sometimea and randomly. It's gross but not really a huge problem, only irritating</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Is it just the conscious act of swallowing because you're thinking about it? Or if you casually take a drink you can't swallow it?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fun fact: I can't blow my nose properly since effexor about half the time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can mostly swallow, i can't really keep swallowing. So it's like my stomach or my esophagus are unaccepting of whatever i try and intake and i just get a swirling regurgitation of food and foam. Not stomach acid or anything, just whatever my innards feel like they dont have space for i guess so eventually i get frustrated of trying and i keep spitting out the foam and whatever. I feel like maybe its a remnant from earlier in life but it's also different

Kind of what i imagine sporadic strictures would be. I can explain how previous me would have affected this if you need

How does one not blow their nose?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Normally, we do something to force air through the nose</td></tr>

DST 

What does it stand for?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Daylight savings time?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have some letters for you too,  for real</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Savings or saving 

What part of speech is that word playing in the initialism, in your opinion</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hmm. That's one i haven't given much thought to. Are you asking if i think it's diectically refereing to the subject Daylight so there should be a verb ending in singular/plural agreement? One could argue both ways

For this instance, i just typed iut what I've always heard, no extra thought given </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Daylight is singular to me at first, but you could argue plurality based on it being more than one occasion over the course of time because in order to ise the system properly you need to have DST twice a year and then it happens every year</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thanks for the thoughts. I would argue against twice a year being a requirement, but that's a different matter

I also said savings most of my life until I saw a discussion that convinced me that saving is a verb here: we save daylight. Savings to me sounds like a plural or mass noun, which is fine in and of itself (e.g., savings and loan), but it does not make sense to me to think of the resource as having some accumulation </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I agree with everything you just said</td></tr>
    <tr><td>NB every year we hear about the idea of switching to DT year-round. I favor this, even though it is wildly out of line with natural time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>As soon as you said it i questioned it lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i am team singular on that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you know what "time zone" we would be in if the zones followed a strict definition based on longitude?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh gosh no</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Central would seem natural</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i doubt it is</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Actually you are correct. Central would be more "natural" based on our longitude</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It had something to do with banks and lumber and shipping and nyc/chicago</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So to think that we would switch to daylight time year round is kind of funny because it takes us even further away from the "natural" choice</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I agree</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fun fact

Besides wanting to know you better, it's helpful for me to understand how you came to be in a similar place with respect to your relationship with your spouse. 

Of course our stories are not much alike, yet we both find ourselves in this, may I say perverse situation where we have to hide things from our partner. Do you agree?

And moreover, I know I've shared things with you that literally no one knows. No one else but you and me and I'm not ashamed of those things, and I feel so light knowing that you have this knowledge and yet you are still here. </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Sure</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can't explain it really well. But over the course of the next 10^gazillion years, there are predictions that super massive black holes will consume all matter in the universe

But it gets worse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Due to Hawking radiation, the black holes will emit all that matter back out as incoherent atoms, which will be spread so thinly that they cannot form larger structures

But it gets worse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The atoms will lose energy and eventually decompose into their consistent quarks and such. 

And the universe will be nothing more than a vast place with nothing meaningful in it</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This is how i think when i get really depressed 

Does that make sense?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It does honestly. And I'm sorry to have chosen this gloomy topic

Yet, as much as we want to know why all the fuss, there can't be an answer. Accepting that can actually be liberating. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kind of. I mean, yes. I have more on that for when we continue the aforeparlayed conversation </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I will say one more but, and then I think you should ask me something 

</td></tr>
    <tr><td>One more bit </td></tr>
    <tr><td>The answer is there is no why. So there is no point in putting energy into that one. It would be like asking what is the mpg of an electric car. It's a silly question, if you will. 

Instead, we can ask what can we do to be our have or go to what we want, and choose

Now you</td></tr>

Do you know what I'm asking?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Right now, I would say I want to spend all night with you. Have some dinner. Have some drinks. And get high and fuck all night, maybe sleeping little bits between. I mean fuck so much that the next day, we can't even think about sex until like 7pm or something 

I realize this may seem "ordinary" or conventional, but this is the thing I am 100% sure of

Does this surprise you at all?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Because i want it too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I mean I could just enumerate all the things we did or tried, and maybe a couple I didn't get to. We didn't do costumes (school girl anyone) so put that on the list. 

I'm not looking for trapezes and chains and asphyxiation here. I wanna fuck your brains out plain and simple</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And actually cum this time</td></tr>

I am so so sorry this all sounds dumb. I literally dont understand but I'm trying</td></tr>

How long does sex normally go?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Her license</td></tr>

    <tr><td>And then I remembered what I actually did forget</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I tried to renew, but the online process asks a lot of questions I could not answer and wanted Affidavits I was not comfortable making. So I stopped, had 6 more beers, and the memory was flushed</td></tr>

    <tr><td>What else would you like to say?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That is all about that, for now anyway. I do want to say more, but I would rather be with you. When I say it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Can you say why?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For information purposes, it makes me think whatever you will say next will be negative to, for, or at me</td></tr>

    <tr><td>She has a freight train full of issues too 

But for whatever reason, we cannot discuss trivial things, like, what kind of mattress to buy? Because she doesn't trust me. And if you think that sounds weird, it is. Now, do you think I can bring up our sex  life?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No way</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I cant here either</td></tr>

I've told these stories so many times to myself, they're getting boring almost</td></tr>

Thank you for telling me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You're welcome </td></tr>
    <tr><td>So I think I've painted a decent likeness of the worst of times around here. It's definitely not always like that. We also have our own spaces, and mostly get along. I can tell she's trying not to assume I'm out to get her, sometimes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's good, i think</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But I don't know where this is going either. She's not bouncing back from setbacks like a spring chicken</td></tr>

I absolutely disagree, even if you were joking</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well I do have a wide jealousy streak that I've been monitoring for about a month now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's actually much less than it used to be</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dare i ask more?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sure...I used to twist my guts into knots hearing my GF/wife so much as talk about another man. I've ruined a few good times doing that and causing a scene</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can stop</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No please don't censor yourself</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This is far less than it used to be</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I need to learn how to hear appropriately</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont know a better way to say this

Except for one person, kind of 2, every story with every partner of mine has ended negatively</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So it's not like I'm thinking of good things you should be jealous of if or when i say anything</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I get it

Two thoughts in response 

I think the negative outcome is not a given. I know it happens a lot. But if we're up front with each other we should be able to avoid the things that can build up and cause break-down

I am finding out a lot about how much I've grown up lately. Many things that I choose to suffer for in the past are simply unimportant now, or less so. jealousy is one of them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I cant say if it's growing up, but ive learned, and that's really evident with what i say and how i act and things with you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aren't we both lucky? I feel that way</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes

And less than yes

But yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I might know the less than part, but would you say why?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lots of reasons. I'll call them all "history"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ahh. I was thinking about the present, not the past. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That starts in the past</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your reason, i think</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And mine, i just labelled it differently</td></tr>
    <tr><td>üòä</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i might be getting better with my panic attacks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Just as an aside</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yay! Let's keep working on that.  Get you some nice endorphin releases</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes but also some different ones </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't think youre aware of when i was about to not be great at the not panicking tonight. That's good.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's good I wasn't aware?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think so</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Was it the eye topic or me not wanting to continue ranting about my wife? One of those?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Was one of those what?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The time when you were " not about to be great .."</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No, i dont think so</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And i dont know how you keep being able to not have me stay peeking down the rabbit holes like i would normally do</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Idk.  I just like you I guess</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Typically i would (being honest here) give myself some hurt or zone out and down reliving things or asking dumb what-if type questions or trying to see what i missed or a lot of other things</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Or I'd just really suddenly be a bitch til it was a lost cause rrying to stop it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right. How'd that work for you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jury's still out on that. I was more productive and felt more like myself, i can at least say that. I don't really know how to do a lot of what's happening right now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok that's fair</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm not some bastion of mental health here just so you know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Always learning</td></tr>
    <tr><td>thiat were you hoping for as a reply? Or what would your reply (as me) have been if you predicted it?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>First word is "what"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A lightbulb moment perhaps. But maybe we need to clear some more cobwebs first</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But now there are also a few things i dont know if i can or should say because i dont know how okay youll be hearing them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh!

That sounds a lot like the situation I was in a while back. Why don't we save that for another day when we can be together

I think the hard bits will be easier that way

What do you think?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I really want to tell you some things but i think they'll make you too sad</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dude you're killing me here

You can tell me that and then not tell me! 

"Not now" is acceptable </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Besides</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm going to be sad at some point no matter what. Don't know why, don't know when. I'd much rather be with you when it happens instead of, say in my basement crying because I've convinced myself you're a suicide risk</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That last part is ambiguous to me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think probably it's an in person thing, so nvm for right now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have thus far told you what 2 people had done. It's still very subjective if either of those are the "worst" offenses. You already know that right?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes, and thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For what?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Saying nvm for now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh, okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BRB 5
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay, good luck</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm back</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That was like 5 seconds lol

Knowing that what you know may or may not be the worst, im curious for what has come to your imagination for what could have been worse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Idk
I can't really

Rape is where my head went pretty early</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your text confuses me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I honestly don't want to cook up answers to that. I was convinced there was something in your past. That evolved into believing it was tape. I did not conjure up scenarios, or scenes, or anything specific</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tape, rape 
Phone does not like a word</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm just trying to listen, and learn. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>One sec</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And I don't continue to dream up possibilities, and cryptic questions like that are very confusing to me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sorry, was interrupted</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think I have a more direct answer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Can I think of something worse? Yes

But I will not, because I don't like horror movies. 

But I still want to hear what you want to tell me, no matter what it is. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>What's up buttercup</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Let me try and explain why i was confused. 

I am breathing really intentionally because i feel bad for having been confusing and i thought i had been really clear.

I have a really, really hard time with that word. I literally cannot say "rape" for anyone. So i default to putting "SA" because it somehow makes it not as bad in my brain. Like I should think of it nicer. I need to work on that.

So. Spelling it out

Those 2 I've told you were rape. That's why your text confused me, because i thought that was already clear that that was kind of THE whole thing of my past</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm sorry about that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And then i got more confused because anyone else in that list of 8 "worst" that i count is also rape

If we downplay to sexual assault and i include less bad things like just being forced for some things and not others (like if we were going with degrees in a court of law) there would be lesser offenses but 8 are unquestionable to me even though i get questioned enough on enough of them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So i wont tell you more stories for right now, but what questions do you have?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok I really appreciate what you told me it clears up some things for me

And I should have known better to be more careful with my language. I will from now on</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It doesn't bother me if you use it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's exceptionally hard for me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I understand</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I wish I could give you a hug rn </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I feel really mean for saying that stuff above</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Like i slapped you in the face</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You were not mean. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think we were both a little frustrated and confused</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Now it's out
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I had also been operating under the assumption that you knew this before we were in dewitt too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At least for a few weeks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We only knew each other for a couple weeks (:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yep</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well

Are you feeling better all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont really know </td></tr>
    <tr><td>My mind is a little bit darting right now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Can I help</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It would be better in person</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i also couldnt have said this in person </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Said that which i had said above, rather</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I follow</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can't tell what is new information for you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You don't need to worry about that. I'm listening and learning</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I do not know another existence, and I feel like all i have ever been and will be is this giant mess of trauma and assaults and abuse and i dont know what to do with that feeling</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I would like to help if I can. Even if it's just to hold you when you are scared, or lonely, or down, or tired </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And tell you that you are a really cool person</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Who has bad things done</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That she did not and does not deserve</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That you deserve to be loved</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And love the way you want to</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I really, truly appreciate all of that

To me, some are definitely not my fault. After attracting so many, it has to be something that I'm doing or have done or i dont know but this is not normal 

I look back and i tried and i asked and i pleaded and begged for so much help and it always failed </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I literally measure how old i was for stuff going on in normal everyday life based on who had done what nonconsensually right before or after or at the same time something else was going on</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And because it's in my head all the time just replaying and trying to rewrite or maybe make sense or find the key moment or find a reason or anything at all, it's consumed everything about me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am tracking all that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Guess what</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am not going to follow that model</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you know my knee jerk reaction to that? </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I might guess</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Which i actively talk down, btw</td></tr>
    <tr><td>"that's what that all say"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Verbatim</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But for my typo anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thanks for giving me a try</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ditto </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I just don't have it in me to be those people</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'd rather jump off a bridge than do half the things you've told me about</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I believe that

But to me i havent told you too much and so then i get mixed up</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because everything to me is/has been "normal" or at least common</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's ok. I hope we can redefine normal for you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Me too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want to try</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want to let you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That is the best thing I've heard today</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I know what i really want too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Got a little misty ngl</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Just now?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dont be. It made me happy</td></tr>

Then you were going to tell me what you really want</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes

I want to have really good, great sex, if that's ever still an option

I want to relax and have fun doing it and not wonder if i look fat or stupid or worry about finishing or not or if im wet enough or if you really want to be doing what you are because you like it or because you want me to reciprocate better than you're doing. I want to drink and be silly and maybe high without worrying about my safety. I want to be okay if my body makes weird noises or has day or week old hair growth or if I'm wearing socks or not because no one will shame me for any of it and there arent expectations but there is fun </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You are in luck!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>If we can find the time& place, I guarantee all the rest for free</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because I also want to have great sex with you, and for me that's about having a great time with you, not all those judgy things, and we can get high if you want, or not, is ok! I just want you and your infinite cuteness and your passion and your hot body and to hold you while you rock and quiver</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want you to have fun too! I want you to get off doing what you want on and in me. I really can't tell you that enough</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh and I do look forward to that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your gonna make me have wet dreams now lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want you to very literally explore me. Show me things. Tell me what you feel and why and how you think i like it and what made you think that way. Ask questions. Ask what would make it better</td></tr>

    <tr><td>She has a single mom (entomologist trained in Malaysia), younger bro, and Mom's mom living in the house</td></tr>
    <tr><td>All of Chinese heritage</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Her mom was always out on weekends, hanging with her boyfriend. She actually encouraged the kids to have friends over, so they would be drunk there and not running the roads. She'd even cook for before she headed out</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cool mom basically</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And she knew we were fucking</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cool with that too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So where else would I be on a weekend lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Anyway one night we were watching a movie or whatever, making out</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I guess I was fingering her down her shorts and just got the courage to ask if I "could kiss it?"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And so I did, and I think she came?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But I had zero idea what I was doing. I knew what she tasted like well enough from my fingers, but this was a new level of course</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She told me I did a pretty good job for first time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And that's the story</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh--</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was always A possibility that g' ma would come downstairs </td></tr>
    <tr><td>She spoke no English</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was hilarious when she did because she'd start washing dishes or whatever and my GF would yell at her in Mandarin. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I learned "wo shi" -- I will wash -- to help usher g'ma back upstairs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Exvellent story time, thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No problem!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So you'd already fucked?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah--i think I told you this a while back but she took me by surprise in my own bedroom. I lost my virginity with her on top of me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I sort of knew that story

I will always take more of it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Did you do this through her shorts? Take them off?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think I pulled them off</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This was in the living room. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>They had a bunch of plush sectional pieces</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Had she had that before?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So I got on the floor and got my face wet</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think so?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She fucked a dude I was band friends with, before me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Btw</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have you been someone's first time for something? What?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's one moment where my jealousy really got the better of me. When it really sunk in that she had been with him I bawled like an idiot for two hours</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was truly ridiculous</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm not like that any more</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's okay to be still</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well a little maybe, but that was kinda excessive</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I've never been anyone's first fuck, but I guess I was a first something or another else</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The prior GF, also in HS, felt my fingers on her pussy, a first for her. We were so not up to speed it was funny, but it was pretty hot and I still think about that sometimes. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>She was at the only reunion I went to and we actually had a good time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She was also a band chum</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And the GF before that, spanning late middle school to early HS , </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I pulled her shirt up and sucked boobs one day--surprised her. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>She wrote me a very polite note where she said she really enjoyed my hands on her but she wasn't ready for the oral part yet</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was really cute</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Also a band chum </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Also at the reunion</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Also had a good time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Guess who was not at the Reunion?</td></tr>
    <tr><td> Boy band mate?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Other R?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Chinese gf. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She married a guy in my grad class. He was there, we had been friends before, and we had a great chat</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Did you need floor shelves or anything?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Another thought for some hanging shelves is to get a hook/finneal/nail and repurpose a shower caddy. Works well for succulents!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you need any kind of furniture?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I might actually want floor shelves if they're sturdy. I know I just bought some. They're full lol!</td></tr>

Like a doctor's rolling stool?

Have you ever been to April's Antiques or Dicker & Deal? On kalamazoo.  Walking distance from afhq if youre ambitious</td></tr>

    <tr><td>You?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I rarely eat out unless I'm working in the office. I can also find something almost anywhere, but there are a couple places I will never go (Meat, for example). otherwise I'm not really picky. RLH can be hypercritical at times so I usually avoid the whole idea</td></tr>

    <tr><td>You drizzling it or am i?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's an actual question - who sauces whom?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Next I have the can. What shall I do?

    <tr><td>I basically agree with you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So do you not gravitate toward one movement or another in terms aesthetic pleasure either?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Say more?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I like impressionism is an example</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't really identify with anything like that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>All my friends in HS fawned over one artist or another. I just can't</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I get it

For me, i like almost all art and appreciate it. Well, most. Impressionism is just somewherw at my core from so much love for it when i was really young.  I identify with VanGogh and Matisse. I like all sorts of stuff. I'll die happy if i never have to study roots of western art from egypt ever again. I had to learn that a million times over, again and again</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Where are some favorite places youve ever been?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Have you ever been to Johnson's in Chartucky?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Haven't even heard of it</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Oh fun!

In Charlotte?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>There's a thriftiquey place there that looks cool</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm sure lol. It's Chartucky!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You could also always find a big piece of wood being randomly used (frame, shelf, whatever) and scrap it for parts lol </td></tr>

    <tr><td>I just bought $210 of stuff at Amazon lol. Glad I waited for prime day... Saved over 70!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Also, think of things as components and not as what they are. Awful art in a gorgeous frame? Now the frame is yours and you can put whatever in it, even just a mirror. Or a calendar.

Cool belt buckle but worn belt? Now you can glue it to a barrette

Cool beltstrap, plain buckle? Now it's your new bag handle

Awesome cylindrical lampshade but no lamp to go with it? Put it around a dollar store trash bin and now you have a pretty office wastebasket

Ooooooh what did you get? 

I just find stuff in my house or the wild lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You're so resourceful!</td></tr>

Or random costume jewelry? They're tiny tree ornaments </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I've thought about it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also spot valuable stuff pretty decently</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nice! I've bought quite a few things from that shop </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I could perhaps be persuaded to sell you goods and/or servjces...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Omg cleaning, you guttermind!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ummm, I was only going to suggest batting for some of my services </td></tr>
    <tr><td>*bartering </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I told you I'm greedy now lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Entirely your fault though</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Why an RV?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It has a bed!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mmhmm mmhmm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And what if i had an open house to myself?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I could maybe avoid Grand theft auto indictment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That'd be nice</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah, I agree. Never been to prison. Not a good look. Don't want to start</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe I'll tell you all about my brother going to jail and me finding out and why no one in my family talks to me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unless you already found that out on the google</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Of Homes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Restoration efforts migjt be unpredictable</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Or Chez Merdard</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Right?!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crazy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And you might feel weird so decide to stop and eat and take a minute</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ofc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't know why there's whipped cream in my ear actually</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Sounds yum!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont think i would have added the chx but not sure if i would replace it with anything</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It would surely work without as well!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I would add cheese lol. And maybe something cruciferoua</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh sure! That would be good. I thought about cheese and decided against it this time. We had an obscenely cheesy casserole a few weeks ago</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fondue? Raclette? Lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Uhhhh Krog√© Sharpe Cheddar </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Oh I am familiar with that phenomenon</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No better way to lose your appetite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yep. Basically any lunch they have catered is something i cant eat most of. It doesnt matter to anyone so i just have to let it go. Same with required in office time when im only supposed to be physically at afhq one day a week</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Does anyone really check that though? You've got Kirby in your court to some extent right?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's only been since this systemic fiasco

And yes. Assholes check.

Kirby was the one who made it happen originally but if it's a directive from his SCVP then it's not possible

Kendell is someone we can usually get on board</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sigh. Control freaks</td></tr>

    <tr><td>JFC did he pass 3rd grade?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nothing except factory floor labor after high school, i think he passed that though.

Nbd. He's a supervisor in the hybrid service center - finance hybrid team now. Not that that should require higher ed or managerial experience or a minimum time in insurance or minimum of an associate degree

Hey wait a sec.... 

Lol but not really</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hmm. Sure would be a shame if someone smelled weed when he was out there</td></tr>

Teasing you with my tongue

And gently biting you while I palm your chubby mound, squeezing and rubbing you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Until I feel your slit getting wet

So I soak my finger in your juices, lightly rubbing your clit, until I slide my finger inside you

First just a little bit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And then slowly I slide all the way in as your hips rise to meet my hand</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can put more or less pressure on your mound as I finger you. How do you prefer it?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also love to suck your nipples at the same time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Can you come this way? 

Or would you want more of me inside you?

I wonder what it's like for you and for me. It seems a little amazing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You are fantastic and i cant wait for more of you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have never in my life craved crying and lovemaking with someone as much and hard as i do right now and with you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can't wait to satisfy your cravings </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I woke up thinking about lying next to you, wrapped around you. I was so turned on imagining you were there, wanting me. 

If you've never fucked on your side, it's a wonderful way to wake up. </td></tr>

A decent rule for me is if I can smell it across the room, it's wrong. 

If I discover it in your personal space, it might be ok

Unless it's lavender or patchouli lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Never!

And that's a good rule

My general guidance is that the most it should linger is if the next person in an elevator pleasantly wonders why they're now a bit happier - there's just a hint of scent left as i walk away but not identifiable</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nailed it

And if I get in the elevator and can't breathe, you should be ejected from the building. There are a few in the service center, I might add, that are in this category. I'm sure there are others too</td></tr>

I mostly hit some part of the scooter on my way down with my shin, so there is a bloody spot on my jeans (I just cleaned up the wound; it fits under a band aid). Tiny road rash on my right palm.

    <tr><td>Straight up </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think it's nor as angry as you should be, but i also think she won't understand because there's not much she actually realizes she's not doing well with</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think it's too nice, kind of.  Like you're holding back </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Interesting. Anything else?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe. Let me reread

And please keep in mind i have no real background for detailed dynamicals, just what youve told me in vague swatches </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sure, of course </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont know how to respond best. What was her shitty behavior? I dont know what actually happened

We can table this for another time, obv</td></tr>
    <tr><td>All good. You are correct I was holding back. She would not have heard anything I said correctly at that point

I can summarize:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>First, she disapproved of me hanging with Patrick this weekend because of a distorted memory she has of him being a drunk. There is a kennel of truth there, but she was also clearly conflating him with someone else from work. And he did use to get drink with Toni 's husband Brad, who became abusive (Patrick was not though, and ended his relationship with Brad at that time)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Second, after I got that clarified, then she changed her argument to Patrick was always bad-mouthing AF, and that rubbed off on me. Which is basically true, but this was my first time hearing it. I've been friends with Patrick for like 8 years or more. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>She stomps off. I go back to work. Then she comes back to apologize. I ask her if she remembers me saying I can't have simple adult conversations with her?  

So third, now her problem is I am mad. I did get worked up and tried to draw an analogy for her: how about I say nope! I disapprove you hanging with Toni! Of course it's absurd, but now she has completely flipped the script:  she can't say anything to me because I get mad. 

I point out I was only dating I wanted to hang out with a friend this weekend--a very normal things to do, and I had no idea she was harboring this ill opinion of Patrick (which has already morphed , as you'll have noticed) but she decided to spring that on me today</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Finally, I never spend time with her. I never ask her on a date. I never ask her if she wants to get dinner. And she can't say anything to me because I get mad. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>So, thoughts?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh, and she didn't say anything to me about going to lunch. I think I was supposed to interpret that as grace. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I held back because there is no listening. She cannot, it will not hear me </td></tr>
    <tr><td>So it's pointless unless she is actually paying attention</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lol I said summarize. I guess retell would have been a better word. Sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm really sorry you've had to deal with all of that

Please do not be sorry

I'm unsure what to think other than i commiserate and wish i could rescue you from this</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I appreciate it. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>What else would you like to say?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I will find the right opportunity to try to explain that I don't feel like we're friends anymore because she acts this way. And maybe that's why I don't want to hang out</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't know when that will be</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She is painting this as "we both did this". I will correct her on that as well. She did this, not me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I understand</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She can deal with that however she wants</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have you thought of any negative outcome that could befall you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>There won't be. Just her being a banshee</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What did you hope and expect my feedback and reaction to be? They can be 2 different things too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I genuinely wanted to know if I am missing something. I still do. I understand this is one side of a story, and there was a lot of who heard/who said. In the past, I usually would find enough wrongdoing of my own to apologize. I feel none of that this time. I have never been this clear about what is going on. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think you're right. I also think she might think you're blindsiding her because you usually say nothing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I can see that. She interprets push-back as anger. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>From me anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you outright say (in a calm voice) " I'm not angey, i want you to know that first... i feel _______ because ________"

Btw, i know these phrases from decades of therapy and am not trying to be critical of you - i know how I've been spoken to and what's effective and blahblahblah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And it can't be "im not angry BUT" because that negates it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And you cant actually be angry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>If you are, then say that but back it up with specifics (not "always" or absolute language like that)</td></tr>

Hair day kinda Mondays, but if I've been getting grubby, as I have this week, as soon as I feel like dealing with it. Which will be tomorrow because it's gross rn

I don't shave much any more, just use bare trimmers. I could shave though -- it would be *very* smooth if I did. Once a week is the norm for me. 

I'd say 75% in bed and 25% in my office. You just never know when the mood's going to strike lol </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh interesting! Really? Office? I kinda like that

So where does it all go? Are your sheets basically cardboard-feeling at this point? Has the mood struck any more recently? I feel like shower was going to be the answer</td></tr>

I have already developed alternative options

What are your thoughts, besides obvious disappointment?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh, sigh...

Well, it does give me a very good way to defuse the situation here. Which will , I think, increase the credibility of my alibi at a later time. 

Devious, yes, but beneficial in the end</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Possibly

Alsp, i am so so sorry! I had no idea this would happen. Literally said he was leaving to retrieve her as he went out the door

On the plus side, he gave me extra cash and stipulationless shopping trips this weekend so i guess there's that

I should have all of next weekend alone here or I'll peace out to a different town, depends what you want

Or i can meet you at a local lodging establishment sunday afternoon, obv me covering this time

Find a local lodging establishment that has a check in time that still leaves a few hours (3pm is common but i can call around). Make those minutes count. West side or dewitt preferred

    <tr><td>I don't mean to suggest that you want to be victimized. It's my armchair psychologist understanding that there is a pattern of behavior in which victims of SA, DA, etc., unwittingly find themselves in such situations again in part because they don't know better for themselves. It's not that they want it as such, but they can't break the cycle</td></tr>
    <tr><td>My response (typed as you were typing too)

I went kind of off the deep end 3 or 3.5 years ago when i heard all this confirmed and some more upsetting stuff about my brother and pieces together a lot. That all happened by accident one day, i just stumbled across the info. I was also trying to deal with my own past SA traumas with a shitty psychologist who made a lot of things worse for me. He (psychologist) "broke up with me" in an email the day i was scheduled to see him, which was the day after tgis new wave of information and realization drowned me. Then i made a lot of bad, slutty, dangerous decisions. Promiscuity is a common trait in SA survivors.  I sought out good and bad and worse and different and everything. I was craving a lot too. 

Ive played with the idea of cnc but i dont think i am mentally sound enough for it to be cathartic like it can be and i dont think anyone i trust enough to engage in cnc with me actually would. Plus i dont fight back or flight away - i faun/freeze and dissociate.

I will never let an SA happen again and that was ultra clear to me 3 years ago all of a sudden

    <tr><td>Yesss</td></tr>
    <tr><td>There is a spot deep up in me that you passed and hit and kept going, and i was positive of what i would feel because that's always like the last part that feels good, the rest always has a stabbing ache for me no matter what and so i was ready for the first time we slept together to have been my only painfree sex at all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's magical for you? </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And i felt you at that spot and was fully bracing myself for the ow and it was still there in my heads because i was so prepared for it but that stab-shock didn't ever happen and i keep looking for it, basically.

I know exactly where i have always hurt and there's nothing at all to indicate you were there</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Magical isn't a fair term yet, but what made you think of that term for now?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am saying i dont know why i didn't feel like someone stabbed me at my trauma spots and it's really thrown off all of me and my thoughts </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also used to/maybe still get really wet and hyperaroused feeling or reminiscing that pain</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So my head is all sorts of fucked up over it and i just want sex 24 hours a day and that has never been me</td></tr>

Sorry I'm such a downer :/</td></tr>

There's not a wrong answer. I'm just asking</td></tr>

Still, no wrong answers</td></tr>

    <tr><td>That's what i meant</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Theory (because it happens to me a lot): too many carbs at once without enough of a satiety nutrient to accompany them. Your pancreas dumps out a bunch of insulin to unlock your cells so they can receive the sugar as a nutrient but your pancreas doesnt get the "stop sending insulin" message until after you've been done consuming the carbs for a while. The extra insulin makes your glucose drop more and your liver is balancing with tiny amounts of glucagok to keep your levels steady but the macros are way off from your norm so your body sends alarms (shaking, sweating, etc) to let you know you need external input to help itself regulate because your body knows something is "off" and your survival brain can find a way to fix itself faster than relevelling between hormones, so it makes you food focused and all that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh I also had more caffeine than usual today, about 2x</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Very interesting!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TLDR: too much sugar, spiked glucose, adrenaline dump from extra caffeine, unsustainable energy levels, insluon compensates, you fix it </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Ty Dr Becca! </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tempeh is good protein, but I don't think overall that lunch is what I should be eating</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And it was a lot more carb load than I would feed myself at home</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ideal macro is supposedly 40-30-30, carb-protein-fats</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have a differebt but similar theory</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont eat pizza, not really (variety of reasons)

One reason is that because it's mostly fat and then mostly carb after that, the fat delays the carbs from getting into your system. Then a few later you have the carb surge out of nowhere and subsequently drop because there's no protein or satiety to carry the sugar spike through. Instead of a steady line of nutrients (like the ideal), you instead would have straihjt upward spike then drop in my forst theory or steady/small drop then upspike then low drop in theory 2</td></tr>

Really though, i was trying to tell you this absurdly ridiculous thing i realized earlier - it's that my body and especially my pussy and perhaps that incredibly sensitive bean baby clit of mine is madly swollen.

    <tr><td>When Daddy spanks you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i like the idea of you hurting me for a few reasons

I obv associate sex with pain. This will sound bizarre, but SA doesn't always hurt but it also still does in the memory in places of your body. After enough oww over years, i get sort of aroused (but not really? I feel throbbing but it's at the bits that have been really hurt before) anyway, and i get wet. I feel pain, my body thinks it knows what's coming next, and it prepares, it's not something i think about it just happens and it's so, so bizarre to feel</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also like the idea of me making the decision and controlling if i have directed pain or not, and i have trust in you that's necessary for me to believe I would be in charge of what i feel and when and how intense. I've never had that kind of control at all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>If I can make that pleasurable for you without feeling gross, I will do it. I think I know where my line is, but I've never actually been there

That said my estimations are conservative, and you can always--always-- say no, or stop</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You are indeed in control. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also know that SAed people can force their bodies to engage in sexual activity even when they're petrified and unattracted. It's natural defense so there isnt more damage</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The control i seek is for me to trust you enough that i dont think about anything and you have ultimate power over me while i trust you entirely to make the best choices. It's surprises and excitement without actual fear lurking anywhere</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I actually believe I understand that, even though I have not experienced it

People who do s&m for fun say trust is a foundation to the pleasure -- I get that at an intellectual level</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think I've made myself clear though. As long as it's fun for both of us, I'm down. You can always yell stop or safe word or whatever and I will respect that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I understand

I mean, i do but i dont know how to trust that 100% even though i do with you? Very complicated</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am Sure it is. All we can do is trust each other here</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This might razzle your brain and I'm sorry: i do not understand that someone does not have a R fantasy

If you do then maybe we talk about it (for a lot of reasons) and i luterally do kot comprehend someone not having that in their mind</td></tr>

    <tr><td>You've mentioned cutting, and I think an eating disorder?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A few of them, yes. And then the other that i really hate labelling because it's more complicated than anyone understands</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't know what will happen if i tell all the stories </td></tr>
    <tr><td>What do you fear could happen?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A few things

My biggest fear is that I'll realize that they're actual things that happened </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Or that I'll remember too vividly </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you feel a need to recall them, or share them?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hmm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I havent done either so i dont know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think it is both</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i want someone to know them and to understand that i really shouldnt be here and be functional

And maybe sharing them will get them a little out of my head</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I thought i wanted something else too, but here you are and i think maybe i want to tell you instead</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i dont want to break you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I see this as --

You have a closet. There or may not be a monster in the closet. Schr√∂edinger's monster? You kind of want to know, but kind of not. It might be horrible for you--and for me--if there's a real monster. But you can't know for sure without opening the door. But every day you don't have an answer. You can't know the answer unless you open the door. 

It's not an enviable place to be. If you want to open the closet, you have my support. If you'd rather wait until I'm physically there, that's cool. Any way you want to proceed is cool in fact. 

I don't think you can break me. I don't think you can hurt me, unless you turn against me, but I don't see that happening. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Schroedingers closet monster indeed

Especially because i also don't know what happens if i stop letting all this stuff consume me. I have no clue who i might be without it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That is almost what I told my doctor when I was about to quit smoking.  "I worry about what I will do with my time". 

I would pose this question to you: what would be worse? can you name a specific thing that would be worse tomorrow because you stopped being consumed by a monster today?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe 

I say that because i dont know for certain it would happen, and it would not be immediate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But do you have any examples? Any daydream idea you've thought of or fantasy you've ruminated on?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I might not ever speak to my mother again

And i might not stay married 

So yes, actionable things could happen. But only if i tell you all of it, which i am not prepared for

I know i want to tell you most of it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's also a closet monster possibility that i engage in self harming activities and i told you i would try really hard to not do those or worse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm not really understanding why telling me anything would create that kind of fallout. 

You said you really shouldn't be here and be functional. I agree with you on a certain level. Your struggles have been many, significant, and very difficult. But youve convinced me you are very real and very functional, and I am grateful for it! </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ofc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I feel like I'm pushing a wedge towards you, and I don't want to do that

Let me know how I can help

And if anything is urgent, please tell me!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>... Last note as a standing PSA </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You are not pushing a wedge </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You're actually being very helpful</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Where do i start then?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ok good to know ty</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe let's establish some things</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>First, I don't believe you can break me. I am a sponge. I can handle anything from you, except rejection. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay, same</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think some of these might make you cry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Quite possible. I'm not concerned about that. I cry when I have feelings and I'm just fine with it. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have i made you cry yet?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Close, but no</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not yet</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay, good</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you remember which?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes, I was very worried last Tuesday night. You were really down on yourself about the HPV test. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You said worried

That is different than crying

Right?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right. That was as close as I've been to crying </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Interesting

Have you been worried aside from then?

What was the worry, if you can name it?

I would also like to know, please, what i would say that you would intervene on if i told you i was experiencitheat the time or relatively recently . This is not a trap, i just need to know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think I was a bit worried once or twice otherwise, nothing serious. Mostly when we don't get to finish what feels like an important conversation. Sorry that's not super specific. 

I think I would be inclined to act on any threat that I feel is credible and would cause you to be harmed </td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's vague</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The last part you said</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you have examples?

I am more than willing to tell you lots of things. I am not as willing to have you intervene on all of them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Wait</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe it would be okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sorry no I don't have a collection of trigger words that I can give you. But I'm always going to try to make sure I understand you before doing anything rash</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Rash, to me, implies acting on impulse and perhaps in heroics</td></tr>
    <tr><td>As of right now, i can only think of maybe 2 or 3 scenarios i feel like you would have imagined now that you would intervene in, and i don't think you would need to because i think i would go into it first with you and there would be a mutual resolution

I'm not saying that's the case, but idk really</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TLDR ...

I think you think you imagine i might try not existing anymore one of these days and at that point you'd do what you had to to prevent me taking a permanent exit

Has that crossed your mind?

Has more than that scenario's sort of threat?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think we're on the same page. Yes it has occurred to me that you may try not existing at some point. I've never thought that was remotely imminent. We agree on definition of rash</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay. Thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It helps if you ask questions, you know

It's okay if you think they're hard or will hurt me or if they make you feel weird to ask</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I actually think hard questions are the best</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right o. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>For now, please know that I think you are an exceptional and wonderful person. I will never wish I had not met you. I know you've endured like 50 people's worth of pain, hassle, abuse, neglect, and I'm sorry it happened to you. I wish I could stop it from happening. And if I can I will. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And yet for all of that, I see you, a wonderful person, passionate lover, well learned, witty and fun to be with, and I want to amplify all those things</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I also think you have a lot of demons following you around. I see you swatting at them from time to time, as if they were so many wasps. I hope you get to put them in their place some day. I hope you free yourself of the worry and pain and nagging and distractions and ill will they bring you. If I ever can help, please tell me. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Can you say that in more specifics?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because i dont really know who you're referring to</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm talking about you metaphorically </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>These demons of mine though... some are people, I'm sure</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i also dont know what else they are for the most part</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Neither do I irl. But do you tell me they're there. Again, metaphorically </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I wish i knew what metaphors you've interpreted this way

But yes. They're there. You can help. You have helped. I dont know how you can help more but I'm sure we'll think of ways</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aside from sexual achievements (which I think are fantastic), anything else I've helped with?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes. Let me think in a sec

I dont think you understand,  though, how colossal these sexual things are</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kind of similar but also not is that i sometimes think I'm attractive now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yay!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>There's still a lot I'm trying to understand about you and your approach of me and how it all works

While i work on thinking about that, i would love for you to ask me something specific.  Something not uplifting because i am sad tonight and that's where my mind is dwelling </td></tr>

Is there a reason you didn't just get what you want when you were the last person doing grocery shopping last week???

I can't be with him that way after he did what he wanted to without any consent from me several years ago. I kind of agree that i deserved it then but also not really.

He is more persistent lately, being touchy and lovey and maiing physical and verbal advances all. The. Time. And i cannot. I just cant. There's not a way for me to check out like i normally could. I cant get into it. I cant not say no. And i cant say no without a huge argument now and huge amounts of me feeling bad about myself for a lot of reasons. 

This is just another reason i cant and dont sleep. Really. 

But wtf am i supposed to do??

There isn't  a way out and isnt a way i can stay like things are and not a way i would want to be physical with him again and he isnt going to stop feeling how he is. And i am completely alone.

    <tr><td>I dont entirely know how to show up tomorrow</td></tr>

    <tr><td>I am so depressed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>100% understandable and allowed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But it's not because i have expectations</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You do you
I will support as I can</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ideally i would not work in office tomorrow

Or i would have a late start/early departure

None of that is probably acceptable</td></tr>

And recharge </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Okay i wont</td></tr>

    <tr><td>CK asked how i was doing this morning</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aww</td></tr>
    <tr><td>My response was "thank you for checking in" and then pivot to working

I think it was more of an indication of how upset i expressed i was yesterday</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Igchh.

My arms are still awful feeling and this tremoring HAS to stop</td></tr>
    <tr><td>HAS</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Why did I do that lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Make evening plans yet?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This is really about avoiding suspicion </td></tr>
    <tr><td>RLH must be feeling more like herself. Last evening she was asking for endless reassurances that I'm not eating out. It was awkward. This used to be a constant topic for her, but I haven't heard it now in a year or more</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No prob</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But..... weird. Yeah?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For her, no</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Am i misinterpreting something?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Dining at an out of the residence establishment or.... a  different, more euphemistic term?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lol the latter</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dont understand why shes asking?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She used to do this constantly </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Promise me you love only me forever</td></tr>
    <tr><td>End quote </td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's a very different sentiment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She wants assurance that she is safe in her relationship </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Only she comes about it by asking for me to promise she is and will always be the only one</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay, i kinda follow that </td></tr>
    <tr><td>But that leaves our a key activity you mentioned</td></tr>
    <tr><td>*out</td></tr>
    <tr><td>My bad, vague language </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Am I looking for other women?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Did she say that?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not verbatim, but very clearly, yea</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And it wasn't so much as she had a reason to think so, but she knows she has been inattentive to our relationship for a long time, and this is exactly what I would expect her to ask if she ever came back to her senses. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And please do feel free to ask anything you want to know about this. I'm sure I'm leaving gaps </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I will</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fuck my arm hurts</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Yep</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you have a mattress topper?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Like one of those foam things?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I guess I can just say no. We've used some things like that in the past, but not anymore. They don't seem that effective, especially for my special needs spouse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She doesn't sleep there....</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yep</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Rarely anyway</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Does she want sex again, do you think?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't know. She peeped about it briefly last night again (before asking for reassurance) but the thing is she *says* a lot of things that she would like/want, but she seldom acts. Plus she is so out of shape and smokes.. she can barely go from room to room without wheezing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hey i get winded too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not that you need my permission,  but you can do as you'd like until it negatively affects me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am not ready to be close to her</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'll see how long this energy burst lasts. I really don't expect it will be long</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I see. We should talk about this</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sure no prob</td></tr>
    <tr><td>From kind of the same POV</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Im sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have a possibly out-there question to ask then</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Don't be sorry it's fine</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lying is unbecoming of you</td></tr>

    <tr><td>I have an awkward question about forthcoming days

Not a bad one, just awkward</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You know me babe

Bring it on!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>How should i decide what to do each day? I plan around other people (you, in this case) and based on what i would want to do, it's easier if i know what your realistic plantenions are

For example, if I'm going to be alone tomorrow afternoon, my choices are to stay and clean, go out on my own, or be here with you. It's insanely hard for me to balance what i should do and want to do with deciding where and when to go anywhere because since i dont drive, when i go out I'm out and when i do that it's for hours but there are also opening and closing times and some places open some days and not others and i can't figure out if i should stay here alone next week or tell L he can bring his sister back and they can stay

The best way i can put it - but i dont want too much pressure - is that i plan everything around you, so how do i decide when i should do other things when I'm waiting on a maybe, and all the available time spots i might have overlap?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Totally understand </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'd feel terrible if I wrecked your plans based on a maybe from me

Truth is I don't / can't plan far ahead for the most part, for reasons, but that's the reality. I think you understand this; I'm happy to say more if you want</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So if you've got something you want to plan that's idk tomorrow and I can't give you assurance I am free, just assume I'm not</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I never have actual plans</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I honestly don't love that but I appreciate you giving me the latitude. I know I'm piss all for availability </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And I want to be fair to you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Plans, aspirations, desires...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Don't let me get in the way</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I appreciate that, thanks

Everything is always a maybe, so i prioritize what i want most and what's realistic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I want to be with you, but the suspicion tax is easy for me to invoke</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Someday, I will not care about that. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's up to you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We both need to be ready for that in some way. Not gonna be real soon</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You're so sweet babe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Like I said, I don't like this. This is not my favorite topic. But it's SOoo much easier to have it when we're just being honest and caring</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Refreshing </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I agree</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This honestly simple conversation is the sort of thing that would bizarrely become emotional warfare over here. </td></tr>

    <tr><td>That said</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm going to figure out what kind of schedule there is with the dither fish(*) and work out if I have freedom tomorrow </td></tr>

Sorry, couldnt read that right away

I should be here par seule saturday and Sunday too. Idk other days yet because it's a decision i have to make partly based on you

Most of the reason i bring this up is because the logistics causes me so much stress because i cannot say no or that i cant make it work with you on an occasion. I figure it out, always have for whatever the thing is</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For sure! I know logistics is stressful for you, ofc. I don't want to add to it at all. That's  my first priority </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Nitya</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We finished with the gifts. She lit candles on the carrot cake, and we had cake. It was quite good (she made it from scratch, and the cream cheese icing) so I think she appreciated the rave reviews</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So presents.... I'm really confused who opened what and for which celebration on which day

Sorry that's a weird focus thing but it'll help me follow the story better if you have a mini agenda or something you can lay out in stupid-people language & format for me</td></tr>

This was very entirely new</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She's very fleshy, which is kinda new to me. I find her very sexy!

That would be so, so hot</td></tr>

This time it was about failing a French exam. Then I was trying to gather my things and they were all over the place and I had to go up and down stairs to find everything and it was all so embarrassing because the prof kinda made it known to the entire class that I totally failed the exam. I could answer the first question </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You did not</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For some reason I had a box of papers in the classroom. It got moved after I left the room. Prof was putting more handouts on it and said we had to read all this by next class (tomorrow morning). 

I was like FML there is no way in hell I can that </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't usually dream of failure and embarrassment </td></tr>
    <tr><td>But this dream also featured a regular theme - labyrinth hallways, stairs, doors, rooms, high places</td></tr>

    <tr><td>It's like the koat literal dream translation interpretation ever, my love</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Say more?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i am your labyrinth - hard to figure out and always more twists and secret hallways and new things, both good and jot so good

My house is symbolic because it's never tidy. Frankly, our dynamic is also "messy" but it's because it is what it is - not anything you can quickly write out and define (like the papers to read and the exam being a mystery)

French that someone speaks better than you... mmhmm</td></tr>

    <tr><td>And i dont think i need to say why "failure" or embarassment are themes but i can if you need more straightforward words </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Haha it's so weird how these things happen</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Can you tell me how?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>I always feel like if i really realllly let myself go into it that my body - at least the kitty canal - will turn inside out and leave my body 

Please respond how i get over that idea, truth of it, etc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Is that how other girls get off? The clamping?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's new to me tbh. Ofc you won't turn inside out, but I wonder if women have similar feelings/thoughts in natural childbirth? 

That said it feels to me like just your vaginal muscles, not your uterus, but I'm not 100% sure. 

I'd be interested to go through the exercise with you... Let yourself fall into it and see where things go. Maybe just the resistance training is good for you? Idk</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes! Please

If you're okay guiding me through and staying no matter what happens - like, literally anything could - then i want that

It's def not my uterus. Ive never been pregnant or had any kids. They had to force that cervixal door open to a few mm just to slam in my IUDs and i had anaesthesia to allow those to happen</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ofc I will be with you all the way! Unless you squeeze me out :) then I will be next to you lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I love the squeeze 
You feel so glorious </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I love and hate it

Because i will squeeze you out if i go into it

Has happened</td></tr>

    <tr><td>If I'm hard enough I might be able to stay in. It kinda worked yesterday </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>How did your instincts not have you go straight down my throat?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You mean cum?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not really (i didnt think you did? Idk)

Your dick

You have an unusual amount of restraint </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ohh

Partly because I'd like to think I have some manners... I don't want anybody to get hurt

And partly because I can feel so much, even just barely in you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you still say "can i fuck you" because it's something you remember me liking?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes, and no 
It's also an opportunity for you to say what else you might want
And it's also a way for me to get out of my head a little and tell you what I'm thinking</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you for that

It did not occur to me that it was more than a binary answer

Like... i didnt know about maybe asking for something else

Why do you need to get out of your head?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For me it's about sharing I guess. Fun fact I didn't even say words like pussy during sex until 10 years ago</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But I want you to know how much I love making love to you </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fun fact - i cant say most of those words.  Still </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fun fact: youve seen sad from me now. Genuine sadness. I didn't know i had that feeling until then</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You are absolutely safe with those feelings around me babe. I hope you will freely share them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you

Dont melt, sweetness </td></tr>
    <tr><td>There were 2 "trigger potential" moments yesterday and i dont know if you know what they were or if i should tell you

I'm okay either way</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I don't know what they were
Well maybe one? You warned me I might get sad</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah. Do you remwmber what that one was for?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You were telling me about the apprehension, not knowing if you were bleeding or what, even though I had not hurt you, because hurt was all you had known </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And here's the thing </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I already know this without you telling me in so many words , because you already told me in different ways. I've been "sad" about this for a few months, but it's part of knowing you and loving you. 

And I want to help you move part the hurt if there's any way that I can. I can't undo what was done, but I can be a friend and safe partner and support you </td></tr>
    <tr><td>That you want me makes me happy ofc. That you want me in spite of the past is something I can only understand if I believe you want to break out of that endlessly repeating cycle of yuck</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And I am all in for that babe, for you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes. And thank you endlessly. I hope you feel at least some of the thanks i try and give you

And yes. Because it has happened before, i really thought all of the wetness was just blood and i was really afraid and embarrassed from it. I cannot tell you how much i appreciate that all-in mentality but because i dont know the damage that was caused or repaired once upon a time, i feel like I'm just another wrong choice away from dying in a compromising situation 

If i was exanguinating at all, i didnt want you to feel like you might have had done something "wrong"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I Certainly hope I am never the cause of that! This is a good time to repeat, you can say no any time you need to. I'm here to love you not to harm you!

What other questions are lingering for you? Im glad you finally stopped shaking! That took a while</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hey! Here's something we should try</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We need to try hydrating you and getting some potassium in you after sex</td></tr>
    <tr><td>To see if it helps the shakes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I saw avocado and <ew> banana recommended </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You wouldn't have been the cause of any harm, and i was having a great time i just thought of how gross and embarrassing it would be and i didnt want you to feel bad and it was also a thought of traumatic instamces constantly haunting me and resurfacing no matter what</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I hadn't really eaten or slept since more than 24 hours prior either</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And there was some trauma response in the shaking</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And good hormones and brain chems too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>For sure</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Speaking in very general terms
You have a lot of symptoms of dehydration ;)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm no good example either</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I do not drink water</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But which symptoms do you know that i have?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And if you can help me be less dehydrated i am 100% for it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I am also tremoring a lot right now and hate it. Just an fyi</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And spouse + SIL just got here. Sorry if i get quiet </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okdokee</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have a banana!  I won't it against you </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I couldn't even say the word lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hydration,  not potassiuK</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Agreed, but partly neurotransmitter related as well</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have a banana And a glass of juice</td></tr>

This was negotiated last week with the condition that my life not be infringed upon by her being here again (you know this saga but this "weekend" is still too much, again, like it always is). So i begrudingly agree with a condition that if i want to go somewhere to shop.or have ciffee or whatever, he'll take me or pick me up or both and doesn't get to harp on what I'm doing or where i go or what i get. Furniture or super large purchases was an exception

So he took me. I reluctantly agreed to try and stick to not tons of stuff or tons of cost. Spent the day doung what i love, obv. 

He came to pick me up later and i was kind of waddling out since there arent carts and i could use 1 arm but i had some bigger weekender-style duffle ish bags over me but also you have to press the door lock things and push the door to get out....

Anyway he screamed that he's had it and he's done and what dont i understand. Chastised more in the car ride home and talked to like I'm literally a toddler. Already felt uneasy with all that and he would not let me speak (and i havent since that moment, with one exception) and more berating and all sorts of that </td></tr>

    <tr><td>And more yelling and downgrading and i tried to turn the noise off as quickly as it started</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What did you do?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Eventually i just went in the house</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So he threw your stuff out of the car on the floor </td></tr>

It's something from earlier today in the conversation. And a lot of people say it. Mostly the other side

It's hurtful to have the idea that after assaults and abuse that i did more harm and was wrong, not "going after" anyone who perpetrated

I think i phrased that the best i could.  You werent mean or callous or intentionally flippant at all, but hearing things like "i dont know why they're still out there" or wondering why i didnt pursue legal or punitive action is a twist to the knofe every time

I know you meant it compassionately, but it dredges up way more than i could ever tell you. Though i would like to tell you some of the branching thoughts from this root of ideology now if that's ok

I also don't want or need an apology, you didnt do anything wrong but i say it to get it off my mind and so it doesnt become an habitual response from you. Or if youre ever around someone else who says it then you can correct them</td></tr>

One of my guy bffs from then (and kinda now) was a mutual acquantance when i met him a few years after my incident and i dont remember the context but the guy had a reputation for being ultra skeezy. Same MO for all of us too.  So so gross to me my face curls.

They hear what HE says for it all too, all his details, how you wanted things and came over completely invited and you werent under any influences.  You could have left during the movie you watched but you didnt. You kissed back. You didnt fight or scream or anything else. You could have called 911 or campus police from anywhere and you didnt. Everyone hears what the officers choose to remember. And the nurse's report and how you reacted when she touched your shoulder and what every millimeter of you looked like, if you had hair if she combed it and what she found and how much and there are picturws of that too

One of my CK meetings was this morning

From Brighton

Hired onto housing staff

Small

Brunette

Ongoing restricted or forbidden flirtation

She broke it off with him 

He refused to date me

"In my experience, it's really in my best interest nit to date anyone who's still a student"

Fuckkkkkk that guy

2 years of that nonsense and anyone and everyone saw it between us. Dating but not. The one person i told a ton of intense things to who shared this trust and never broke confidentiality in mandatory reporting, actively kept me alive and in school and employed and away from home and

I. Am. Not. Her.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Both working housing duty on February 14. I made scratch lasagna and tuxedo strawberries in his kitchen. He got me flowers and cards all day. No one in their right or wrong mind would tell you there were mixed signals</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Was that a story about a person you dated harboring feelings about his ex gf?
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Who is him</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You missed the part where i said he wouldnt date me after he dated Rachel who was unbelievably similar to me

Him is named Mike. Was the hall directir who hired me. And her fir that matter. Actually hired me to replace her now that i think about the housing places that needed to be filled when i became an RA. She broke him so i was fun to get attention from and for him to lead on and so on and so forth. For 2 years. 

When noon hit on the day we closed down the dorm and he migrated to a different position at Ferris i brought up that he was no longer my boss and "im not moving to east coast for another few days, im completely dateable and encouraging you, we'll both be around next year and it would be a lot of fun" </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I got the invite to go get lunch (for the rest of staff) with him and hang out in his car doing so. Then i got some pats on the back for the balls i had for saying anything because he knew it was probably terrifying for me to be that vulnerable

I told him that i knew he knew because (names) werent subtle and i knew they joked with him about me and my smittenness for those preceding years

So he made sure i knew that "for what it's worth, [he] didnt need anyone to say anythingggggg since it was pretty obvious we had a thing anyway, just couldnt have it official"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And then "in my experience,  it's best not to date anyone who's still a student"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dude. 5 years older. And i wasn't a collegy coed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeesh</td></tr>
    <tr><td>He was the first i told a lot of shit to, and all the rest.... plus knowing he joked with other staff AND his friends (who were my friends but not mutual of that makes sense?) Like.... stabbed over and over</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That was a very long time ago. I am obviously still hurt and flabbergasted by it all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh yeah! He also visited me a handful of times when i moved to an apartment on campus</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hey call them out!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And graduation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And he met and conversed with my mother</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Under what pretense?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh damn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I forgot this</td></tr>
    <tr><td>He was my boss and she was visiting is when they talked</td></tr>
    <tr><td>He was in town from out of state was me and my apartment </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Huh</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I wish you could see my expression and the mannerisms right now</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Do you have any idea what they are? I have more to say</td></tr>
    <tr><td>No it sounded like you were in the middle of something just now though </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kind of. Kind of not. I'll keep thinktyping if you can describe what you think my physical processing of this looks like</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You must be exasperated </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because it is just now occurring to me that he wasnt ever the type who wanted physical gain from this, and he wasn't the malicious type (to my knowledge), but i was hopeless and it probably felt great for him to have me parade around all cute and be smart and sassy and have goals and depend on him and him know he didnt officially break any rules 

And there was all this connection of dark and twisty but still outwardly positive and taking over life even though it kept fucking us over

I don't know what i was. I was so sure we would end up at least messing around for a while, if not dating. 

I'll get some pics from then so you can see who each of us is in these instances.

I was at the very literal darkest parts of my life more than a few times 

So maybe he liked being the rescuer? Maybe he liked the ego boost? Knowing me better than other people could because i just never said anything to anyone but him? He knew so, so much and now I'm really turned upside down

Was it just fun to have a silent power trip?

I write this letter to him that i never sent and all it was was me crying and pleading and wondering if i was too messed up mentally because of everything and that's why he didnt want me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>He would see me stay awake for days, see my cuts, know when i didnt eat or when i was in a vomiting cycle, was the first one i told about my brother

He held me in the hallway when i had a panic attack while we were in the group of a dozen of us training for dorm scenarios we needed to be prepared for and i collapsed in a flashback because the scene we had was to figure out how to manage a sexual assault in one of our residents if it happened</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Babe I'm so sorry!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And the people who acted it out, the girl was a friend of mine and knew exactly how i was from my assault the year before and basically was me in the act for that training and could have verbatim been me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So im in the hall because i needed to get out of the room and im sobbing unsilently and trying to swallow air but im like a fish drowning in oxygen and he comes out and i barely know him much at this pount but he puts his arms out and i dont know what to do but walk to them and then i am on the ground because i have ptsd and the present state isnt there anymore</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not only do all the dorms look the same, but this dorm where we're playing pretend for training was THAT GUY'S  dorm and there's so much there too that i want to tell you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And i know i told Mike what happened and he didnt judge or pause me or gaslight me or shame me or ask dumb questions and it was literally the first time i think anyone believed my assault wasn't my fault </td></tr>
    <tr><td>And so there was that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I got way off track</td></tr>
    <tr><td>So it is going through my head now </td></tr>
    <tr><td>My poor baby!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That even though it was fun and "i knew what i was doing" the whole time  and it was reciprocal and mutual and consensual and "i knew he was an authority but not really"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i was wrong</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because i dont think that was true?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But it was to me and i was so sure</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And I'm still reassuring myself that he was what i wanted and i was what he wanted and who cared if either of us was right or wrong because i was positive i made those decisions of infatuation for myself or that nature made them for me </td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i mean, he wouldn't have done that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And there wasnt anything physical, no officially crossed boundaries, no harassment and not even consensual harassment or locker room talk or whatever you'd call it. That wasn't even there</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have always been smart and mature and can see BS from a time zone away</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Except i dont think i do now

And i know what i gained, kind of, but it's so much clearer that i lost a lot, but what did he gain? Not really anything. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Control maybe? But if it was that then maybe he was actually doing me a favor because stuff could have been worse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I made a lot of terrible decisions then</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Would have could have should have made more</td></tr>

And I'm not trying to play any kind of twisted game with you or your emotions, but i don't know how it would be to not understand the act. I'm trying to gain that insight.

In this moment now and a lot of times like it i dont really know how to describe the feeling of defeat i have. It's like i dont care enough to actively die but not a ton to prevent it either. And right now it's hard when I'm not well and i see this pro and con list kind of like long swathes of luxury ribbon and the pro list is so short and the con list curls up at the bottom because the ribbon is so long. 

I get impulsive a lot, but not to the stage of instantly taking a bunch of pills or ingesting anything else or even injecting. I dont know why. That's been the case very few times, and in those instances i was too young or dumb to know what would have been truly lethal. Small victories i guess for that.

But in the down and out when i think of how there's so much i will always have to fight for just to keep existing, or surviving, and not even living,  it's just not worth it anymore to me.

You were clean and tasted like nothing. I wasn't intoxicated at all. You didn't expect me to pay for everything pr insist on you doing everything or ask me about if or what i charge. You didn't push.

    <tr><td>Hmm

That's a little bit of a weird answer

Maybe? I knew lots of things had happened. I accepted bad things to keep happening. I did not know things (like that night) could be just good. 

I have thought about these things constantly for a long time. I didnt look past the iceberg tip, i guess?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Don't you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I do</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Do you fancy double insertion?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That is to say, anal and vaginal </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I fancy everything with you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Heh!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I admit I'm not exactly close to wanting this</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But porn ... Has left me with this uncommitted opinion </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sometimes it looks truly awful, and other times truly hot</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And part of my lack of understanding is my lack of understanding anal sex</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Just to lay the cards out lol</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Youve felt me. I dont think doubling up is possible</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah, you're right really. You don't have a lot of room</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sorry, love</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's fine, no don't even</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was just a question, not a desire </td></tr>

    <tr><td>My goodness no</td></tr>
    <tr><td>One thing has happened once to me and it was with you and i had to literally ask someone wtf had happened</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The other concern is that if i let myself go full force orgasm, i already feel like me vag will turn inside out. You know this. What if it's so intense that all the other contents of my body explode everywhere? I would literally die being so embarrassed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>As much as you feel this, I think it's a trick of the mind

No less intense. But not deadly</td></tr>

But anyway

I dont even want to put the words here (then again it was kind of your fault lol)

It was the one time after we tried some doggie style. You evidently pumped a lot of air into my kitty canal. When you left the channel, all the air fell out too. And made noise. And felt weird af.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>I know</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I dislike the word</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Some words are just sharp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I actually did not notice, though I've experienced many times

    <tr><td>Anything else?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Have you had this issue before me?</td></tr>

Which issue? Air pockets?</td></tr>

Just saying you can bail without prejudice. </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Heh you might regret that reminder</td></tr>
    <tr><td>My feelings about self-harm (1): Confusion and sadness are the dominant feelings. It also scares me. And this precedes you; I first learned about self-harm among Millennials and GenZ when my non-bio niece in AR made a mess of herself. She's morbidly obese, grew up in abject poverty, had a horrible mother (who died young from complications of diabetes). Her father is the sick brother-in-law the fam is trekking to AR to visit. (She's fine now. Still 400+ lbs, but tackling life successfully.) Then I learned my closest coworker was a cutter. He shared it with me. I don't ask about it. You explained it to me in a way that helps me understand why you did similar things, but it makes me very uneasy. I don't want to hide from the knowledge, but I don't know what to do with it as someone who cares about you.
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mike treachery (2, 3): I'm not super clear on this, but it seems like he liked you but wanted to keep you at arm's length. Idk why. It is surprising to me how long you two kept this going. And he didn't jump your bones? Guy's either got a lot of self-control, or he didn‚Äôt actually care (and I don't believe the latter, based on your story).
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Job satisfaction (4): I can only relate my own experience here. I do the extras not because I want to be recognized, but because my satisfaction comes from a happy customer and a job well done in my own view. I am always my harshest critic. Recognition is nice and all, but I've found that few actually understand what it takes to do the thing worthy of being recognized. I don't care about that. And by that I don't mean "I'm bitter and dislike that people don't get it". I mean "My customer is happy. I know I did a good thing. The fools around me are content to do minimum necessary and that's their loss." I legit don't worry about what others think any more. Life is too short.
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What sexual gratification looks like (5): Kinda funny, but as I'm writing this I realize my answer for this is kind of similar to the job satisfaction one. I know I did a good job if my customer is happy and I'm happy with how I serviced her. And in many ways, that's good enough for me. I suppose some of what I feel here is learned behavior because I've spent a long time having vanilla sex and, you know, after 30 years you might just get to a point where this is normal. I do have fantasies that are out of that box but in the moment I think I default to what I know. And I'm ok with that. I'm not saying I don't want to try other things. You know how I say I need to get out of my head? This is what I'm talking about. How to escape the learned behavior and try something new? This is not a well-developed skill for me.
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Phd guy (6): I don't know enough about this relationship to give you any feedback. All I can gather is the guy has kinks, but I don't know what he did or didn't do that left you upset.

I remember it didn't take too long before we were at this point. I wanted you soooo much. I think you asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this, and I was sure. I also think you had to help me find my way (and still do lol). It took a lot of pushing, and when I finally got in there, it was so amazing! You were wet inside, and it was wonderful! And as we got into it more, you kind of relaxed inside, and it kind of felt like you gushed all over my dick‚Ä¶ an incredible sensation that would happen a few more times that night. Damn I want you now!

    <tr><td>[Repeated from 2023-01-15] 
Last night I was a bit high and we were snuggling and having a good time when I fucked up bigtime. I told her about the drunk  I had with a drunk, nameless, faceless short and pleasingly plump girlie at the Machine Shop... The shows had just ended and people were going for last potty and I was milling around on the floor vibing in the energy of the show that had just finished. This girl is suddenly waltzing up to me, wraps an arm around me, and we spin around with actually some grace and I have one arm around her and have the presence of mind to grab her tit--

And then it was like a scene in a drama movie when the power surge blows up the lamps in the room and everything goes dark but for bits of sparks here and there.

And then it moved on</td></tr>
    <tr><td>There will be a time when i wont know how to say no to you

May i have suggestions please?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What would you like suggestions for?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We will not do mushrooms for a bit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>If at all who knows</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's fine. And i could say no to that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ofc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>There will be a time when all i want is to be physical but i shouldn't. And ifi have the cjance to spend time with you, that's something i always think of</td></tr>
    <tr><td>How do i say no to you when i want the same thing but it would be detrimental to do the thing?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Could be, not a for sure would be</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hmm
Can you say more
What is the thing you reference?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>As an example

Sometimes I might want all the sex with you but maybe i hurt but because it's you and i know plenty, i wont care and will want to do 1000 different kinds of sex and not care about any pain</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh dear
Do I hurt you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Not usually</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And never in the moment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And never intentionally</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ah fuck. Now i feel bad </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aww 
Well hold up</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Don't despair on me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Okay </td></tr>
    <tr><td>What do you need?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You can always tell me no </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Or different ways</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But if it's a problem we should address it </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I wont tell you no though

Mostly likely</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think i would like to address this though. That sounds feasible. 

But you didnt do a single thing to have this happen and it's really important you understand that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok I believe you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thank you</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I feel really awkward now </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nana</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yeah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Na na na
We just need to stay in close communication </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Why?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because causing pain is not on my list of things I want to do</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I know

And you didn't </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Let me think of how to describe this</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nothing hurt on Wednesday </td></tr>
    <tr><td> Not really yesterday either</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I noticed today</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i can tell if it's real pain or if I'm imagining it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Even thiugh you didn't cause me either of them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And i can't really make it better but i also dont know if it's actually there or i keep asking myself if i feel oww so i think it into existence </td></tr>
    <tr><td>But my body and i dont always think the same, so maybe it's imagined anticipated or remembered but that makes it real</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's confusing and it sucks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Where exactly is the sensation?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Where i imagine you'd be at the end of me but also more on my left and i know that's weird</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh, inside </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Like, the absolute coremost part</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You had intense orgasms
Could part of this be muscle aches?

I'm not trying to discount this in any way, just spit balling </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have orgasms in more than one spot

And this is more like pinching or scratching, not aching

I appreciate the spitballing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's also a lot of mental fuckery</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok
Interesting 
And thanks for the additional info</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right

So it doesn't bring back actual memories, this is irritating more than painful

But</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It makes me get involuntarily wet and i hate that because i know what my body is thinking and it makes me mad.  I have zero control of any of me </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oh I was not expecting that!
Does it make sense to you?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Which part? Getting wet?

Yes, physiologically</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right ok</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Why did you say you know what your body is thinking and it makes you mad?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Because i think my body (she, hereforth) feels something that is not really pleasant but also not quite neutral, and this kind of weird twinge is reminiscent of literal trauma 

And so the body preserves itself (it's why fetuses can spontaneously self abort if the mom is nutritionally deficient since the mom cant even support her own needs, and why in hypothermia people lose limbs when blood necessary for survival keeps the core/vital organs warm instead by rerouting blood supply), so anyway, to prevent massive actual trauma, self lubrication is not necessarily only when I'm aroused</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The arousal and fear and dopamine and pleasure and pain centers in my brain are essentially the same thing. In a lot of brains like mine</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And knowing this and not being able to do anything about it makes it suck worse somehow</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Im sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That is indeed tricky</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm sorry too</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What can we do</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You should never be sorry</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Any chance positive reinforcement can help?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Well, now that i dumped that hot garbage on you, i do have another idea in progress that maybe just one area is affected by dehydration lol

Positive reinforcement would definitely help</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Alright</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's ok babe don't fret</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm all for positive reinforcement</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe I can vanquish the little monster with massage, licking, etc</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I would love that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Get you into a permanent state of orgasm </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I almost did that once </td></tr>
    <tr><td>It was actually not a good time</td></tr>
    <tr><td>But i was also high as fuck without knowing i was and without ever having used anything. And not in a place i knew or with people i knew, really</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right
That sounds problematic </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Just us two</td></tr>
    <tr><td>We can poke and grab and such and fuck all day</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Always safe together</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I try and kkow that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I do know that but sheeeeee still has anxiety</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right I understand </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You can't wish away some things</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Correct</td></tr>
    <tr><td>And sadly for you, the scale is realllllly offbalance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I mean it when i tell you that youre the best i will ever have</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Gotta pause you for a sec. Tupe what you want and I'll let you know when you can send</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ok</td></tr>

So i actually understand why some people can never get out of impoverished places and it is not a matter of willpower all the time </td></tr>
    <tr><td>I could have done that to get whatever social assistance there was but</td></tr>

    <tr><td>I love when you talk during sex too

I have so much going on in my mind that i need to talk to be okay

If i am weirdly quiet it's usually not a good thing.  When i havent been able to talk around you, it's because there's nothing left in my head and i am pure euphoria</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Here is something for which a solution would be fantastic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I have a stack of med papers/itemized things

I need to sort them by issue. Like, one admission followed by weeks of iv antibiotics but all the same serviceable claim

How do i best sort them?

I have hard copies or scans</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hmm
I'm not quite sure what you mean by "issue". Is this like an admitting diagnosis?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Maybe?

It's just for me, for aflac

So if i went to the er, then got admitted, then a temp proline, then iv antibiotics at home for a few weeks, then proline removed, that's one thing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I see</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I'm not aware of any data that identifies these encounters as related in some way. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>How would you group them?

As in you, Mr Holaday</td></tr>
    <tr><td>It's a purely human task. I would look at them, and knowing the story around them, I would put them in the same pile. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Similarly, when I got IV antibiotics for my knee infection, I was seeing an ID specialist. Their billing said nothing about the injury, but I know they were related</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What is your favorite font?</td></tr>
