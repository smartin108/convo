Basically there isnt a whole lot more trauma thar anyone can do that i havent experienced at some level already and the worat that happens is i die, and ive been okay with that for a long time

I wonder the same, in reverse. Especially because no one sees me, ever.  I showed you the impressive things so you wouldnt dismiss or forget me and ao i could show you i was worthy of your time. It also reminds me that i am not nothing

I really like you too</p></td></tr>

I need to put phone down and sleep

My mom became an on call firefighter and emt when i was 8 and i have no recollection of my father's familial involvement other than mandated holiday pictures. Like, no idea when he came home from work or any of that. So she would get paged to a fire call and that would always be a minimum of an hour and change of us being at the house alone.

He only has my number because my brother accidentally gave it to him one time. It really was an accident.

My mother made me call him while i was sitting in the ambulance and the house was still in flames and my brother was about to be brought up in a body bag. It wasnt that she was too sad - her sister and her best friends were tgere and ao was her fire department. She just hates him that much. Her best insult has always been a reactive "you're just like your father" if she was really pissed off. To my brother or me.

That father of ours lives in Florida now. At The Villages. Go ahead and google it. He moved there like 12 hours after telling me.

They divorced when i was 13 or 14. He moved out and lived 4 miles away. The next time i saw him i was 24. He lived in Gaylord from some time after i was 18 until he moved to Florida.

To me, his last day of living and the last time i saw him or any pets or that my house and belongings existed is August 8. I woke up August 9. So for those 2 or so hours in between,  it's schroedingers guess. And i have no idea when he died either. Official cod was carbon monoxide but there was plenty else it could have been. I have more to say on that maybe but whatever. He was unsaveable at any point during the fire, so August 8 makes more sense to me.

He was not touched by any flames. Fire moves up & out like a mushroom cloud first and he was in the center of the basement. That's always a question whether you want to admit it or not. I also remember very little for a while after that, so the 8th is as good  as any. It's also easier to remember because it was my cousin's birthday</p></td></tr>

    <tr><td><p>Hmm. That's one i haven't given much thought to. Are you asking if i think it's diectically refereing to the subject Daylight so there should be a verb ending in singular/plural agreement? One could argue both ways

For this instance, i just typed iut what I've always heard, no extra thought given </p></td></tr>

    <tr><td><p>Thanks for the thoughts. I would argue against twice a year being a requirement, but that's a different matter

I also said savings most of my life until I saw a discussion that convinced me that saving is a verb here: we save daylight.

I have a really, really hard time with that word. I literally cannot say "rape" for anyone. So i default to putting "SA" because it somehow makes it not as bad in my brain. Like I should think of it nicer. I need to work on that.

    <tr><td><p>Interesting. Anything else?</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Maybe. Let me reread

And please keep in mind i have no real background for detailed dynamicals, just what youve told me in vague swatches </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Sure, of course </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I dont know how to respond best. What was her shitty behavior? I dont know what actually happened

We can table this for another time, obv</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>All good. You are correct I was holding back. She would not have heard anything I said correctly at that point

I can summarize:</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>First, she disapproved of me hanging with Patrick this weekend because of a distorted memory she has of him being a drunk. There is a kennel of truth there, but she was also clearly conflating him with someone else from work. And he did use to get drink with Toni 's husband Brad, who became abusive (Patrick was not though, and ended his relationship with Brad at that time)</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Second, after I got that clarified, then she changed her argument to Patrick was always bad-mouthing AF, and that rubbed off on me. Which is basically true, but this was my first time hearing it. I've been friends with Patrick for like 8 years or more. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>She stomps off. I go back to work. Then she comes back to apologize. I ask her if she remembers me saying I can't have simple adult conversations with her?  

So third, now her problem is I am mad. I did get worked up and tried to draw an analogy for her: how about I say nope! I disapprove you hanging with Toni! Of course it's absurd, but now she has completely flipped the script:  she can't say anything to me because I get mad. 

I point out I was only dating I wanted to hang out with a friend this weekend--a very normal things to do, and I had no idea she was harboring this ill opinion of Patrick (which has already morphed , as you'll have noticed) but she decided to spring that on me today</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Finally, I never spend time with her. I never ask her on a date. I never ask her if she wants to get dinner. And she can't say anything to me because I get mad. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>So, thoughts?</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Oh, and she didn't say anything to me about going to lunch. I think I was supposed to interpret that as grace. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I held back because there is no listening. She cannot, it will not hear me </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>So it's pointless unless she is actually paying attention</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Lol I said summarize. I guess retell would have been a better word. Sorry</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I'm really sorry you've had to deal with all of that

Please do not be sorry

I'm unsure what to think other than i commiserate and wish i could rescue you from this</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Thank you</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I appreciate it. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>What else would you like to say?</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I will find the right opportunity to try to explain that I don't feel like we're friends anymore because she acts this way. And maybe that's why I don't want to hang out</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I don't know when that will be</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>She is painting this as "we both did this". I will correct her on that as well. She did this, not me</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I understand</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>She can deal with that however she wants</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Have you thought of any negative outcome that could befall you?</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>There won't be. Just her being a banshee</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>What did you hope and expect my feedback and reaction to be? They can be 2 different things too</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I genuinely wanted to know if I am missing something. I still do. I understand this is one side of a story, and there was a lot of who heard/who said. In the past, I usually would find enough wrongdoing of my own to apologize. I feel none of that this time. I have never been this clear about what is going on. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I think you're right. I also think she might think you're blindsiding her because you usually say nothing</p></td></tr>

Go somewhere platonic (shopping, drinking, food/coffee, chomping gummies, idc)

Find a discreet field? Lol

Find a local lodging establishment that has a check in time that still leaves a few hours (3pm is common but i can call around). Make those minutes count. West side or dewitt preferred 

Go to the hot tub place and do whatever.  Possibly not sanitary enough for you but it IS an option

It's not that they want it as such, but they can't break the cycle</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>My response (typed as you were typing too)

I went kind of off the deep end 3 or 3.5 years ago when i heard all this confirmed and some more upsetting stuff about my brother and pieces together a lot. That all happened by accident one day, i just stumbled across the info. I was also trying to deal with my own past SA traumas with a shitty psychologist who made a lot of things worse for me. He (psychologist) "broke up with me" in an email the day i was scheduled to see him, which was the day after tgis new wave of information and realization drowned me. Then i made a lot of bad, slutty, dangerous decisions. Promiscuity is a common trait in SA survivors.  I sought out good and bad and worse and different and everything. I was craving a lot too. 

Ive played with the idea of cnc but i dont think i am mentally sound enough for it to be cathartic like it can be and i dont think anyone i trust enough to engage in cnc with me actually would. Plus i dont fight back or flight away - i faun/freeze and dissociate.

I will never let an SA happen again and that was ultra clear to me 3 years ago all of a sudden

Is that what you needed?

Thank you

To be clear, i haven't felt the need too much to stop existing. More like a need to self harm, which i promised you i would talk to you before doing. So when i realize it, i ask or i say something

That's what i was referring to

I can kind of explain the rest, depending on what you want to know

    <tr><td><p>Theory (because it happens to me a lot): too many carbs at once without enough of a satiety nutrient to accompany them. Your pancreas dumps out a bunch of insulin to unlock your cells so they can receive the sugar as a nutrient but your pancreas doesnt get the "stop sending insulin" message until after you've been done consuming the carbs for a while. The extra insulin makes your glucose drop more and your liver is balancing with tiny amounts of glucagok to keep your levels steady but the macros are way off from your norm so your body sends alarms (shaking, sweating, etc) to let you know you need external input to help itself regulate because your body knows something is "off" and your survival brain can find a way to fix itself faster than relevelling between hormones, so it makes you food focused and all that</p></td></tr>

    <tr><td><p>And it was a lot more carb load than I would feed myself at home</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Ideal macro is supposedly 40-30-30, carb-protein-fats</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I have a differebt but similar theory</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I dont eat pizza, not really (variety of reasons)

One reason is that because it's mostly fat and then mostly carb after that, the fat delays the carbs from getting into your system. Then a few later you have the carb surge out of nowhere and subsequently drop because there's no protein or satiety to carry the sugar spike through. Instead of a steady line of nutrients (like the ideal), you instead would have straihjt upward spike then drop in my forst theory or steady/small drop then upspike then low drop in theory 2</p></td></tr>

I obv associate sex with pain. This will sound bizarre, but SA doesn't always hurt but it also still does in the memory in places of your body. After enough oww over years, i get sort of aroused (but not really? I feel throbbing but it's at the bits that have been really hurt before) anyway, and i get wet.

    <tr><td><p>You are indeed in control. </p></td></tr>

I can't be with him that way after he did what he wanted to without any consent from me several years ago. I kind of agree that i deserved it then but also not really. His pov is different than mine for that instance. I say spousal assault, he says angry sex. I can still describe every second of it in detail and would rather die than relive that

He is more persistent lately, being touchy and lovey and maiing physical and verbal advances all. The. Time. And i cannot. I just cant. There's not a way for me to check out like i normally could. I cant get into it. I cant not say no. And i cant say no without a huge argument now and huge amounts of me feeling bad about myself for a lot of reasons. 

This is just another reason i cant and dont sleep. Really. 

But wtf am i supposed to do??

There isn't  a way out and isnt a way i can stay like things are and not a way i would want to be physical with him again and he isnt going to stop feeling how he is. And i am completely alone.

It's insanely hard for me to balance what i should do and want to do with deciding where and when to go anywhere because since i dont drive, when i go out I'm out and when i do that it's for hours but there are also opening and closing times and some places open some days and not others and i can't figure out if i should stay here alone next week or tell L he can bring his sister back and they can stay

The best way i can put it - but i dont want too much pressure - is that i plan everything around you, so how do i decide when i should do other things when I'm waiting on a maybe, and all the available time spots i might have overlap?</p></td></tr>

This was negotiated last week with the condition that my life not be infringed upon by her being here again (you know this saga but this "weekend" is still too much, again, like it always is). So i begrudingly agree with a condition that if i want to go somewhere to shop.or have ciffee or whatever, he'll take me or pick me up or both and doesn't get to harp on what I'm doing or where i go or what i get. Furniture or super large purchases was an exception

So he took me. I reluctantly agreed to try and stick to not tons of stuff or tons of cost. Spent the day doung what i love, obv.

It's something from earlier today in the conversation. And a lot of people say it. Mostly the other side

It's hurtful to have the idea that after assaults and abuse that i did more harm and was wrong, not "going after" anyone who perpetrated

I think i phrased that the best i could.  You werent mean or callous or intentionally flippant at all, but hearing things like "i dont know why they're still out there" or wondering why i didnt pursue legal or punitive action is a twist to the knofe every time

I know you meant it compassionately, but it dredges up way more than i could ever tell you. Though i would like to tell you some of the branching thoughts from this root of ideology now if that's ok

One of my guy bffs from then (and kinda now) was a mutual acquantance when i met him a few years after my incident and i dont remember the context but the guy had a reputation for being ultra skeezy. Same MO for all of us too.  So so gross to me my face curls.

They hear what HE says for it all too, all his details, how you wanted things and came over completely invited and you werent under any influences.

Everyone hears what the officers choose to remember. And the nurse's report and how you reacted when she touched your shoulder and what every millimeter of you looked like, if you had hair if she combed it and what she found and how much and there are picturws of that too

She broke him so i was fun to get attention from and for him to lead on and so on and so forth. For 2 years. 

When noon hit on the day we closed down the dorm and he migrated to a different position at Ferris i brought up that he was no longer my boss and "im not moving to east coast for another few days, im completely dateable and encouraging you, we'll both be around next year and it would be a lot of fun" </p></td></tr>

And there was all this connection of dark and twisty but still outwardly positive and taking over life even though it kept fucking us over

In this moment now and a lot of times like it i dont really know how to describe the feeling of defeat i have. It's like i dont care enough to actively die but not a ton to prevent it either. And right now it's hard when I'm not well and i see this pro and con list kind of like long swathes of luxury ribbon and the pro list is so short and the con list curls up at the bottom because the ribbon is so long. 

I get impulsive a lot, but not to the stage of instantly taking a bunch of pills or ingesting anything else or even injecting. I dont know why. That's been the case very few times, and in those instances i was too young or dumb to know what would have been truly lethal. Small victories i guess for that.

But in the down and out when i think of how there's so much i will always have to fight for just to keep existing, or surviving, and not even living,  it's just not worth it anymore to me.

And this precedes you; I first learned about self-harm among Millennials and GenZ when my non-bio niece in AR made a mess of herself. She's morbidly obese, grew up in abject poverty, had a horrible mother (who died young from complications of diabetes). Her father is the sick brother-in-law the fam is trekking to AR to visit. (She's fine now. Still 400+ lbs, but tackling life successfully.) Then I learned my closest coworker was a cutter. He shared it with me. I don't ask about it. You explained it to me in a way that helps me understand why you did similar things, but it makes me very uneasy.

    <tr><td><p>Mike treachery (2, 3): I'm not super clear on this, but it seems like he liked you but wanted to keep you at arm's length. Idk why. It is surprising to me how long you two kept this going. And he didn't jump your bones? Guy's either got a lot of self-control, or he didn‚Äôt actually care (and I don't believe the latter, based on your story).
</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Job satisfaction (4): I can only relate my own experience here. I do the extras not because I want to be recognized, but because my satisfaction comes from a happy customer and a job well done in my own view. I am always my harshest critic. Recognition is nice and all, but I've found that few actually understand what it takes to do the thing worthy of being recognized. I don't care about that. And by that I don't mean "I'm bitter and dislike that people don't get it". I mean "My customer is happy. I know I did a good thing. The fools around me are content to do minimum necessary and that's their loss." I legit don't worry about what others think any more. Life is too short.
</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>What sexual gratification looks like (5): Kinda funny, but as I'm writing this I realize my answer for this is kind of similar to the job satisfaction one. I know I did a good job if my customer is happy and I'm happy with how I serviced her. And in many ways, that's good enough for me. I suppose some of what I feel here is learned behavior because I've spent a long time having vanilla sex and, you know, after 30 years you might just get to a point where this is normal. I do have fantasies that are out of that box but in the moment I think I default to what I know. And I'm ok with that. I'm not saying I don't want to try other things. You know how I say I need to get out of my head? This is what I'm talking about. How to escape the learned behavior and try something new? This is not a well-developed skill for me.

Last night I was a bit high and we were snuggling and having a good time when I fucked up bigtime. I told her about the drunk  I had with a drunk, nameless, faceless short and pleasingly plump girlie at the Machine Shop... The shows had just ended and people were going for last potty and I was milling around on the floor vibing in the energy of the show that had just finished. This girl is suddenly waltzing up to me, wraps an arm around me, and we spin around with actually some grace and I have one arm around her and have the presence of mind to grab her tit--

And then it was like a scene in a drama movie when the power surge blows up the lamps in the room and everything goes dark but for bits of sparks here and there.

The last time they ever talked was a year and some change before that funeral. He died a couple years back. My mother was not invited to, told about, nor did she attend Ron's funeral</p></td></tr>

    <tr><td><p>Imagine you're the person who cuts checks for accounts payable. You have a database of acceptable payees, which is fine because you have to know who you're paying to prevent fraud and process 1099s at the end of the year. 

I hand you a list of 350 payments that need to be made. I've looked up all the payees in your database and spoon fed that information to you.

You come back and tell me "these 12 can't be processed because they don't exist in my database"

?

Right. It turns out that in the time it took me to look up all of this information, "they" have done some maintenance and invalidated a dozen payees for no apparent reason. Oh well, I guess I'll go look them up again. 

Oh look it turns out your department inactivated 3 payees I need to get paid.

Oh look it turns out your department flat out deleted one.

Oh look it turns out your department changed the code use to identify 8 other payees. 

It took me over an hour to figure out what your department fucked up.

How do i best sort them?

I have hard copies or scans</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Hmm
I'm not quite sure what you mean by "issue". Is this like an admitting diagnosis?</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Maybe?

It's just for me, for aflac

So if i went to the er, then got admitted, then a temp proline, then iv antibiotics at home for a few weeks, then proline removed, that's one thing</p></td></tr>

As in you, Mr Holaday</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>It's a purely human task. I would look at them, and knowing the story around them, I would put them in the same pile. </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p>Similarly, when I got IV antibiotics for my knee infection, I was seeing an ID specialist. Their billing said nothing about the injury, but I know they were related</p></td></tr>
